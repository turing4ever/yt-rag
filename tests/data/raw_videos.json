          "content": "- I'm JR Smart, President and\nCEO of Smart Motors Toyota. As a young child, I was enamored\nof all the new vehicles. My father was a dealer,\nhis father was a dealer, so I'm a third generation dealer now. For me it really boils down to the people that are in this business. I have spent a lot of\ntime working side by side with technicians, with parts\npeople, with salespeople, on my way up, putting together a\nfantastic team of people that have a shared passion\nfor the automobile industry as I do. Growing up, I accompanied\nmy father to the dealership on many occasions and learned\nby working closely with him, working at his side, he taught me the value\nof honesty, integrity, all those things really come\ninto play in this business, particularly because it\ngets a bad rap sometimes. My grandfather started\nthis business in 1908. He worked out of his\ngrandfather's livery business, so actually we're a\nlittle over 112 years old. Along the way, we've had\n28 different franchises and 26 of those are no longer\nhere, they're long gone. We picked up the Toyota franchise in 1966 and coincidentally enough, I was along with my father\nwhen he penned the deal with Toyota on that fateful day. Fast forward to today, I've been involved in\nracing for over 40 years. Currently, I drive a Formula\nAtlantic, Toyota-powered, and also have a Mazda-powered\nFormula Atlantic, but Toyota has a strong relationship with the racing world as well. At one point, Toyota had\napproached me to purchase an LFA, never dreamed that I\nwould purchase that car, I just kind of put it out of my mind and I'd had heard that they\nhad the leasing program and I was not a fan of that\nso why would I do that? But then as time went\non and they relaxed that and started offering them for sale, it started to make a\nlittle more sense to me and it built up in me, let's say that. One of their representatives, man by the name of Mr. Paul, I believe, came to my office, brought\nhis books and colored charts and so forth with him and we went",

          "content": "(gentle music) - The interior of the LFA. This was a new direction for the brand and they wanted to represent the change in quality and craftsmanship and when you look at this,\nwith all the years removed, you can tell how they've\ncarried over bits and pieces and added them to cars\nlike the RC, the GSF, and of course the LC 500\nis mostly representative of what they've done in\nterms of leathers, fabrics, build quality, handles,\nalloys, it's all here, with the exception there is\nfar more carbon fiber in here and that is the big differentiator\nin the build of this. The entire tub, the driver\noccupant cell is all CFRP. Now, the details, you have\ncarbon fiber on the sills, most of the door material\nhas this glossy carbon fiber, and of course, if you\nwere optioning this out, there were 13 different\nways you can do Alcantara, you could do leather color\nstitching and all the buttons. Everything in here feels\nlike it's precision designed and that's really what this car was about. In terms of using this, you see the traditional Lexus\nmoving motorized gauge cluster that has been carried in\nall the F products so far, you have a carbon fiber key,\nyes, you have to turn a key, we place this in. To start the car, you\nhave the parking brake which is electronic, you\nhave two paddles here. To go into neutral, you pull them both towards you and then you can start the\ncar with the start button on the steering wheel, (car engine revving) but we'll talk about driving it later. When you grab the steering wheel, it's got a really decent amount of grip because the leather area is\nwhere you're supposed to grab, it's got alloy pedals in it, one of my biggest complaints about this, and Ferrari does the same thing, the pedals are attached to\nthe column, not the wheel. So if you're getting to\nthe point of crossed over, or if you're starting\nto lose control of it and you wanna upshift to\nkind of stabilize the car, you have to take your hands off the wheel and it's one of the most\nfrustrating parts ",

This is Randy Romans, one of the owners of the Roman\nGroup's personal automobile and it only has like 75 miles on it. - Yeah, and even JR who's\nmatte black LFA we had, he would have to take\nit to a Lexus dealership and part of the experience\nof owning a Lexus is coming to like a\nflagship store like this, when you see it from the outside, when you come flying\nin on your private jet, it looks like a palace, the showroom is ridiculous, the theater, all the little amenities\nthat they pack in here, this is what they're trying to\ndo is make you feel special. - These two dealers are best in breed, they are the best examples of\na Lexus and Toyota dealership, and this is the experience\nyou should expect. - And if I had an LFA, this\nis exactly what I'd want. But just briefly to talk about this; if you're gonna do\nthings like oil changes, you could bring it to\na dealership like this who is very competent to do it. But if you need any serious work, it's going to be\ntransported to California, or if you're in Europe, it's going to GAZOO Racing in\nCologne to do all that work. This is a highly specialized car and when you look at it front to back, you're gonna start to understand why as we bore you for the next 72 hours talking about every single detail you've probably never heard before and hopefully, if you\nknow a lot about this, you'll learn something. - So let's start with the\ndevelopment story of this car,",

What is your dream? And I wanna to build a sports car. And after a year of\nresearch and development and product planning, they came up with this thing. - So Haruhiko Tanahashi, he was kind of in product planner future planning for these types of cars, and it was in the back\nof his mind for a while. And when he pitched this idea. - [Jack] He didn't wanna\nbuild another minivan? - No, he didn't wanna build something, I'm sure obviously if you're an engineer, you wanna do something out of the box. So after this they\nstarted this whole plan. And over the course of\nthe year it went through what do we wanna do? He had a diary of the entire process and one of the things they decided right away early on is\nit wasn't just gonna be some like four cylinder\neco pile piece of sh**, it was gonna be a real\nsports car high end, they did not want a baby like\nCorolla turned sports car, this was gonna be a bespoke machine. So by the end of the year, they kind of had an idea\nof what they wanted to do. Toyota was in Formula One, this was phasing out the\nV10 days into the V8s, that was what they were going for and they planned on doing a V10. Now, as time went on, he was promoted to chief\nengineer of this project, he oversaw the LFA works, which you're gonna get into, but the main thing that\nhe wanted to instill was he didn't wanna make this\nall about the engine first, he wanted to make it\nchassis and suspension first because he had patents in\ntwin tube damper technology and some chassis components so his roots were in making a solid car. - This car was suspension first. We all think of the V10, but at its core this\ncar is meant to handle, his philosophy behind that\nwas the hand of Buddha, he wanted a car that\ncommunicated with you, that coddled ",

          "content": "They had--\n- A Mercedes. And so this car set the groundwork for things like your LC 500. - [Mark] Correct. - [Jack] The GSF and the RCF. - After about five years, they were pretty deep into the development and one of the controllers had\nbrought them into the office, and they kind of kicked around the idea of doing the body and carbon fiber, which they didn't wanna do because they didn't possess\nthe knowledge to do it. They didn't have the team, they didn't have the\nfoundry, they have the works, the autoclaving, they\ndidn't have any of it. So Tanahashi's San, he's like, yeah, let's stick with aluminum. The controller brought him\nin and said, guess what? We're switching to CFRP and he is like, what was happening? We're almost done with this car. - If you think about it, Mark, most cars only have a five or\nsix year development period. Can you imagine you're almost done and your boss is like you\ngotta throw it all out, we're starting over? That's what they did effectively. - That's what they did. And so he went and talked\nto Fuji Heavy or Subaru, and was like we gotta\nswitch this car to CFRP, what do you think? What do you think the\ndevelopment cycle is gonna be? And they're like that's\nprobably not a good idea 'cause it's gonna take at least 10 years, 10 year plan to get this developed and he's like, well,\nwe don't have 10 years, we have like a year. So they worked on this and\nthey figured out how to do it, bring in autoclaves and mind you, none of the\ncraftsmen that they had there ever worked with carbon\nfiber to this level before. They had Formula One and autoclaves and all the equipment to make race cars, but making a race car is far different than making carbon fiber\nfor a production car. So this is what they worked on, they figured it out, they figured out how to do\nthe robotics to cut the carbon and then to do the molding\nprocess, to handle it, take a little hair dryers\nto make sure it was perfect, a lot of trial and error, but obviously as you see\nthis even the ",

          "content": "So, what else do we have on the front to talk about, Jack? - [Jack] So let's talk about\nthe suspension architecture. So you have an aluminum subframe and all of the suspension\ncomponents are aluminum, both the control arms\nand knuckles, everything. - And the knuckles are forged and you have hollow arbs or\nhollow sway bars to save weight. You have an aluminum steering rack, Jack. - You do. And this is an EPS unit, Mark. This is a column mounted\nelectric steering rack. - They all argued that they wanted a\nhydraulic steering rack, however, you have to run hydraulic lines, you have to have a pump that creates some type of pumping losses, and when you look at how\ntight this is in here, having this allowed them to lower this and you can see the shaft, the steering shaft is almost\ntouching the subframe. I mean, there's like\na millimeter in there. - [Jack] You're not working\non this car in your garage. - [Mark] No, you're not. And if you do I wanna see\nthat and I wanna talk to you. So the rack almost looks\nlike a manual steering rack, is super slim, super small, and then the power assist\nunit is in the column itself. And because this car doesn't\nneed a lot of assistance, except when you're getting-- - [Jack] It's almost a manual rack. - Correct. It essentially turns itself off. We're not gonna get much more into that, let's talk about the dampers. - Okay, they are KYB dampers\nand they are $9,500 a corner. - [Mark] Oh, that's it? - [Jack] Yes, real affordable. - [Mark] So the dampers\nwere co-developed with KYB on the LFA race car. So these look like race shocks, they have a remote or piggyback canister, this maintains pressure and it helps to reduce the\npackaging of the shock. If you didn't have the remote canister, your shock body would be much longer. And since this is a smaller, more compact, double wishbone suspension, it gives them a lot more flexibility so the compression stroke can be, that oil and gas can be\noffloaded to this canister, but the other benefit is heat m",

          "content": "- All right, Jack, in the\nrear my favorite place to be. Let's start with cooling,\nthere's a lot to talk about. First, let's talk about what's back here. You have a transmission\ncooler and you see the lines. The side panel has an\nairflow duct that comes in, cools this, and then runs to the gearbox. The second piece of cooling that we see are the two rear bumper mounted radiators, all the coolant goes there and they have a low engine\nmounted centrifugal pump that flows the coolant back here. And one of the reasons that\nthey put these radiators in the back instead of the front, - [Jack] Is you have limited surface area to work with in the front to actually get all the air in you need so much like in say a C7 Corvette or a lot of the race cars, you have to ducts on the\ntop of the rear fenders that feed air directly\ninto these heat exchangers. - [Mark] And the other\npart was weight balance, moving more weight to the back, and why would they want to do that? - [Jack] So this car they were targeting a 48, 52 weight distribution. They wanted this to be rear weight biased because many professional drivers believe that is the ideal\nbalance to get a car to be. - [Mark] Instead of 50, 50. - [Jack] Yeah. - [Mark] So the next\nthing, back to the cooling is this whole center tunnel here. This was used as a heat path\nfrom the front to the back, there is an aluminum cover we have sitting on the floor there and we'll show you the footage, there are up kicks in this cooler that connect the two little pipes that move air up through this to move air over the exhaust manifold and then all the heat. There's also two of these\npipes under the hood, which you do not wanna fill up with water, but those blow air downward and all of the heat goes all\nthe way to the center tunnel and flows through the underbody\ncover out the exhaust vents by the taillights. So I mean, I don't wanna\nsay it's over engineered, but it's so ridiculous what\nthey had to come up with and then also, because they wanted to",

          "content": "So this is the meat and\npotatoes of the LFA, this is what people remember this car for and this is the V10. However, before we talk about this engine, let's talk about the hood and some of the carbon fiber body panels, like this hood here is $18,500. And the reason they went to\ncarbon throughout this car is obviously, as we talked about earlier, it's more rigid, but it also helped them\nsave 220 pounds of weight throughout the body of this car. - One of the big reasons besides weight is when they were doing their testing and they were building a race car with LFA is they couldn't get the\nperformance they wanted, the chassis wasn't right,\nand the speed wasn't right, the lap times weren't\nwhat they were expecting for the amount of work they put in. So they figured the 220\npounds would help them in terms of damping chassis setup, you'd have a more rigid chassis as well and then it would help out. - [Jack] I mean, it paid off. This was the fastest\nproduction car around the ring when it did come out for\na short period of time. - Which means nothing, and I think the last thing we'll\ntalk about during the drive is really how it feels and that's what they\ntalked about development. It was about how the car\nconnected with you more than anything else and that is, - This V10. So everyone knows it's a V10 but here's some interesting\ntidbits about it. This V10 is the size of a\nV8 and the weight of a V6 and the way they accomplish that is a clever use of materials. So this has an aluminum block. The aluminum block was manufactured in Toyota's then defunct\nFormula One factory. - Yeah, by the time they got around to making the engine, they had already been out of Formula One due to the economy mostly and the fact that they were\nhaving some difficulties internally with it. So they had this high\ntech, high end facility that they could do all their milling, all the engine manufacture process that they couldn't do\nanywhere else in the company so it was a blessing in disguise.

You see videos, you see the information that's available out there in the internet and some of its good, some of its bad, but one thing I can tell you is what I expected this car to be, it's not at all like I expected. - [Jack] How so? - I think what I didn't really know is that Lexus focus more\nabout the chassis development and the handling, so the side effect is\nthis is more sports car. I thought it was gonna\nbe a GT car and it's not, this feels like a sports car\n- Sports car. - Yeah, super car, and that of course (Jack laughs) then they could develop the\nengine for all that handling. And the thing that I\nnoticed getting in this with the stock tires, this\ncar moves around a lot. They wanted it to be a bit more edgy and more of a drivers car, it's not supposed to be like a slide fest, it's not like the Jag F-type or a Hellcat where you can--\n- It's edgy. - It's very edgy. - You have to correct for it but when it does step\nout, you have to catch it, it's not a Chris Harris drift\nmachine like the F-type is. - It's more of a precision tool and the suspension stiffer\nthan I expect it to. It's definitely one of\nthose, you wanna catch it, or if you don't catch it it's going wrong, it's going sideways. And the next thing that I didn't realize and yes, we know this has a single clutch and the single clutch\nfeels very rudimentary compared to the new\nsystems, 10 years removed. But what it gives you is\nthe sense of mechanical feel and you hear the gearbox in the back when you shift gears, when it upshifts, there's like this shotgun\ncocking in the back. It's like this guy's like,\noh, there's a little robot and they're changing the gears and it sounds like a manual transmission, it feels like you're shifting\na manual transmission. - There is an unbelievable\namount of theatrics when you drive this automobile from the way the gauge clusters, from the way it looks, to t",

It's a 2015 Mustang GT, the performance pack. What is the performance pack? So, the performance pack is the smart choice for anyone who really wants to drive their car. It comes with Brembos. You get different springs and dampers. You get some cooling. You got an oil cooler, bigger radiator, different gear ratio. Makes sense. Uh, and what have you done to it? What are the modifications? So, I've done Coney yellows and a rear bar and slightly bigger tires, which it still puts me in F Street, stock class for autocross, all you solo guys out there. Okay. So you're running there. It's a squared set of tires though. Squared set. Yeah. 275 all the way around. RS hand Handcook R3. Handook RS3. Okay. So all in. How much was the car with the modifications? 355. 35. Now that's interesting because I just bought a used M3 2013 that was $48,000. And that's because of the low mileage. So you're a douchebag for driving. I am a douchebag for driving. I'm actually parked in a handicap spot. I got my own silo for this just because it's an M3. But we want to see the difference between the two cars. My This M3 is bone stock. Yeah. Uh the only thing different from a stock car is it has Bridgestone Patenza S04s, which which aren't really a track tire. No, they're not. But they're a higher performance tire, but you know, they they don't handle heat very well. Stock brakes. So, we're going to see the difference between the two cars. Okay. Your pile versus mine.

          "content": "Following his line and not mine. There you go. The the M3 is extremely capable. I mean, there there's no doubt about it. The the chassis balance is this is what BMW is known for. And on this cool down lap, I feel extremely satisfied in the performance of it. more so than I did the first drive that I had on the track. I think with just a really good set of tires, some real brakes, or at least brake pads, uh this would be a very, very fun track car if you're prepared for the running costs of it. Of course, we just finished our track day. I'm really surprised by these results. So am I. I've been a huge fan of the M3 for the longest time. And I'm not knocking the car, but it was slower. Well, tell So, tell me a little bit why it's better. So, it's faster than the straightaways stock for stock. Mind you, I have stock pads still. The the Bremos are they're incredible compared so much deeper. You I mean, you have no brake problems with this Carl. You don't even think about it. And it gives you hard sessions I've run here at 20 minutes a pop. You know, off for 20, on for 20, no brake fade, nothing. Okay. Now, the conclusion of this video, it was a lot of fun to do. And you would think because I have an M3, it's the best car and I should be a total douchebag about it. But the reality is it's not as fast as the Mustang. And what does that say? It says that you don't need to have a higherend or a luxury car brand or a prestige brand to have a lot of fun if you want to drive",

And that's something you're going to learn the more track days, the more performance driving you do. And you don't have to break the bank. The Mustang has so much better brakes than the M3, which makes no sense. It still handles great and it's faster in a straight line, which is mind-blowing in a more reliable package for the most part. Now, the thing is, if I did upgrade the M3's brakes to something like an AP Racing set of Radical Calibers and rotors, yes, it would be better. If I did tires and brakes especially, I could outpace the Mustang GT, but look at how much money I would have to spend to do it and the running costs in the long run. And that's the whole point of this cheap speed. Look at what you can get today. So, I had a lot of fun doing this. Uh, I think at the end of the day, there's a balance to be had. If you had the money, obviously, if you get into an M3 or a German car, cars like that, you're going to say, \"My god, this interior is amazing.\" Especially when you get out of a Mustang and you think, \"My god, this thing's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] box.\" And, you know, it is what it is with that type of money. But again, take a look at some other cars out there. Don't just get stuck in a onetrack mind that this car is the best. Do some of the research.",

More on that story after this. I just I felt Never mind. In the previous video, I dnsed the Z because the original one looked like robot bacon. I don't know if robots eat bacon, but regardless, I got some new ones that just need to be painted to match. I also color sanded and polished the paint job since it looked like it was sprayed with a Super Soaker and painted the hood vents black. And before I reassemble it, genuine Nissan part OEM. What this is is a thermo switch for the EFI system. >> This the time switch provides an earth connection to the cold start valve, >> which this thing runs pig rich at startup. I don't know why they call it pig rich cuz pigs can't have money. They've coins. Ow, that really hurt. I choked on spit at the same time. Feels like my head's bleeding on the inside now. In addition to those temp sensors, I also got a new O2 sensor for it because that kind of goes hand in hand. There we go. Tada. The original O2, which was a Bosch part. The new O2 also Bosk part. It's already got paste and crosswasher, so I don't have to do anything. That should do it for that. Oxygen is now sensible. [Music] Got to keep you on your toes. I'm jumping around quite a bit in this video. This bracket is not on the replacement panel. And there's three spot welds that hold it in place. Yep. Now I'm deaf. It's a fair argument to say that I could have reworked these original panels and repainted them. Tada. Bracket removed. I'm going to need these. However, I didn't because inside and out, these things are covered in rubber undercoating. That would have been a miserable job. Now, before I prep these for paint, all the fitment must be perfect. And I know you're probably looking at this going, \"It's red. Why Why do you need to paint it?\" Well, it's slightly different red. Now, I had also considered painting this e",

It makes a lot of sense and it's one of my pet peeves is rock chips. So, by all means, I'm going to replicate, which means 80 grit is required to give this some tooth for it to bond to. Don't want to sand all the way through. I do have something in case I do, but I don't want to. The stuff that I'm going to be spraying on this can't be sprayed DTM, which stands for direct to metal, cuz that's obviously how you spell direct to and metal, unless of course you're talking about the number two, but that also would start with the letter T. So, it's still DTM. Nothing to do with the German race car series though. Although that's awesome. All I really need to do is the front. >> I had a point to what I was saying and then my brain broke. Red scotch the inner part. >> The new car. >> Hello. Welcome to the following day. That's a cute envelope. Another genuine Nissan part. I know this is a giveaway car, but this is the stuff that matters on old cars. Don't use cheap crap. I'm going to lose coolant when I do this. I don't think I got enough plugs to replace this one. A little bit of citrus degreaser. All right, that's clean. I could very well use my digital voltmeter and the tech data and measure to make sure these sensors are actually functioning correctly, but it is uh likely never been replaced. So, I'm going to put another genuine brand new one in there just because it's 42 years old. Any decent technician knows that just throwing new parts at a problem is not how you effectively troubleshoot. It's just stupid and wasteful and then you never know what the actual problem was. But because of the whole purpose of this car and its age, putting brand new OEM sensors in there is kind of it's an insurance thing. It's a nice thing to do for whoever might end up with this car because they're expensive and it's just I don't know. It's good maintenance practice. I look a",

In addition to fixing the front lower balance on this car, the side skirt area also suffers from a different similar problem. From here down, although there's some overspray of something on there. It looks like spray paint. All right. All right. All right. All right. Well, that is satisfying. That changes everything. I might have to change my plans here because I didn't think. No, I'll do it. There's a spot right here that needs my attention. Betting the half acery is going on over here. So, that's black right there. And that's not just wiping off. I think this was originally black down here from the factory. Don't mind me while I block what I'm doing with my fat head. That little black blob you see is an area where the rubber undercoating had peeled off and developed some surface rust. Initially it was a lot smaller than this, but last night I wire wheeled up around the area where it was failing, treated it with o so that way no more corrosion can grow. Luckily the metal is still solid right there. So, I really want to just sand down the entire rocker and redo the whole thing, but then that just leads into the rabbit hole of repainting the whole car. And I don't have enough time left or the budget to do that or a paint booth. What I do have though is a can do attitude and nature's paint booth. Wow, that is adhesed really well. Yeah, I definitely don't want to redo all this cuz that is bonded. Just trying to get any area where it's failing, but the wire wheels not even taking it off. How did people screw this up so bad when jacking up cars? When it comes to repairing pinch welds, smooth brain pliers are the best invention ever. Not sponsored, just the tool itself. If you own a used car or buy a used car and these are all dked up, this is so satisfying. You can dehamburgerify this metal. It probably is a little bit weaker just because it",

Would have made sense to detail and paint correct the car after I did this. All these areas that I treated with OSO and P are requiring some tooth for it to adhere to. Although, I'm pretty sure this stuff would bond to the rubbery side of a chicken that's so sticky. Prep it with a little bit of waterborne wax wax and grease remover. All right, should be enough tooth right there. Oh, this thing just sprayed my face. Why is Why is everything junk? [Music] acid etch primer. Any areas that I burnt through when I was sanding with 80 grit to prep, I need to coat in this stuff to replicate the OEM finish on the lower chin spoiler. I got some tintable dinosaur liner and some color matched tint coat to the factory color. This is clear but textured. This is red. But red. I got to mix it with a hardener. So, it's a 2K process. And in theory, this should be more durable than what came on there from the factory. Even though I just got this made up, I'm going to mix it really good. I need this to match absolutely flawless since I'm doing a blend job with it. So, 4 oz is half of this. That's 4 oz. Now, hardener. 8 oz of this stuff there. Please be enough room.

If you didn't know where it was, you wouldn't even really pay attention. I also redid the bottom portion black like it's supposed to be from the factory. Unfortunately though, it started spitting rain, so I can't shoot the lubers. I got to wait. I know on camera it looks like the bracket is a different color, but that's actually just because this is misted in overspray and it's ecoat underneath. So, this actually color matches the car. [Music] I probably should wait at least a day for this to harden, but I'm impatient. Wow. That for being a different I'm actually impressed at how well that matches. I mean, that's pretty good already right there. The original hardware that held the center portion in was Phillips head screws and they were all stripped. So, I'm replacing them with the same thing, but a 10m head instead. It'll make it a lot easier for removal. That fitment is pretty damn good. Just got to tweak it a little bit and it will be perfect. Probably should have did this when I had it not bolted in, but it's whatever. Sam Witwiki. Why do I have that stuck in my head? If that airbox doesn't scream 1983, I don't know what does. Like, how sick is this? It's painted like a weird industrial baby blue gray color. The air filter that's in this thing is already brand new, so I don't need to change it. Whoa. Yeah. Can't have that.

Still got to paint the rear window louvers and put those back on since it was raining out and I couldn't finish that. But before I do, those sensors I replaced. It's going to be stinky. [Music] The belt is loose. I can hear it squeaking a little bit. [Music] It's idling. It's better than it was. a lot better than it was. It still struggles at cold start. So, I think what I need to do is take the cover off on the AFM and on the throttle body itself and clean up the contacts in there really good and do some voltage checks and see. Also, there's a potential the ECU might have bad or leaking capacitors in it that's screwing with the AFR when it's cold like this. [Music] Yeah, it seems like just at idle the AFR is a little wrong. So, I had the cold start injector unplugged that whole time. So, if everything is working correctly now, that might have been why [Music] Good news, bad news, good news, everything I've done has not been for waste. Everything that's been replaced has improved how this car runs. However, below 3,000 RPM and at cold start and idle, you can still hear it's a little choppy, which leads me to believe it is the things I said it would be earlier. So, anyone that owns one of these cars or has owned one of these cars knows exactly what comes next. This guy and this guy. I will be tearing those apart and we will be looking at 42-y old electronics and to see if I can repair these and make this thing run good. And as of the day I'm filming this, I only got a couple more weeks left to figure this stuff out and get it going. So, no stress cuz I have a condu attitude.

          "content": "Hello, people of the world watching new vehicle reviews on the internet. Welcome to this, the 2025 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road. With the available six-speed manual transmission, the one feature I feel the new Nissan Frontier was lacking from making it the ultimate holy grail midsize pickup truck. So, today I'm going to see if it does make the difference. [Music] This Tacoma's tow capacity is 6,400 lb, which is a little less than the Pro 4X Frontier, which was 66 and change. Stainless steel, single exit exhaust. Pretty big diameter, too. Kind of wild. The frame rail comes right to the edge of the back bumper. Off-road package with a temporary use truck donut for a spare. Mounted on a steely, though. Outback, the TRD Taco utilizes a fivelink multi-link rear suspension with solid rear axle. In the Frontier, you get a Dana 60 rear axle. On the Taco, it is proprietary source from Heino Motors, Toyota's HD division trucking company. And this one has a 430 final drive ratio with the electronic rear locker since it is the manual. Also, a huge advantage is these mono tube remote reservoir redbody rear shocks. Rear anti-uway bar mounted to the front of the axle measures in at approximately 23 mm in diameter. On these fourth generation Toyota Tacomaomas, selecting the available six-speed manual transmission not only reduces the price by $1,100. It also reduces the weight of the truck on this TRD off-road double cab premium package. It weighs in at 4650 lb, about 100 lb lighter than the automatic transmission. As far as transmission goes, while yes, you can get this with an 8-speed auto. This one is equipped with the IEN RC60F high torque six-speed manual transmission with the IMT2 auto rev match feature that you can enable or disable whenever you want. And it has a maximum torque input rating of 550 Nm or 406 pound feet. With the manual transmission, there is noticeably different engine calibration. I'll get to that in a little bit. But as far as a four-wheel drive system's con",

That front anti-uway bar measures in at approximately 33 and change millimeter diameter. And again, paired with those remote reservoir mono tube coilover Billstein dampers. Pro 4X gave you double steel front skid plates. Whereas this, you get some composite fiberglass plastic stuff on an off-road model. All right, time for the braking test. Nothing behind me. Ready, set, go. Okay. very swoopy. A noticeable amount of ABS feedback and uh stopping distance maybe a smidge longer than average was expecting for. This video is sponsored by me, my very own car detailing product company, RoboBubble, made in USA. And if you'd like to use what I use to keep my cars clean and also support this channel, this is how you can on my website, sarendon.com. Thanks. That breaking was just made possible thanks to a set of four piston Adix front calipers with a 340 mm or 13.4 in front rotor. The wheels, they are a 17x 7 12 with a positive 55 mm offset TRD alloy wrapped in a set of 33in BFG Goodrich all-terrain TA tires. hairy carpet inner fender liners. Take note of all the mud stuck to it still. And ride height, you get about two fists width or about 11 inches of ground clearance. Functional vent, nonfunctional vent, LED fogs, trail cam. It just looks naked without that signature silver skid plate with the red TRD logo that is synonymous to these trucks. Got that nice thick, durable texture chip guard underneath the base and clear all along the rockers. On top of that, the leading edge side of the bed has a clear bra and this little plastic trim piece. In the rear, plastic inner fender liner. Notice how much cleaner it is. Spare tire placement definitely hinders your departure angle. Because of the people that review cars for a living that complain too much, the fourth generation Tacoma now has a disc brake outback rather than a drum brake. It is a 310 mm or 12.2 in rotor with a single piston ",

          "content": "which I have not figured out a way to defeat it. Unfortunately, I don't think you can. What that does is makes it essentially idiotp proof. So even if you don't know how to drive a manual, you could still drive this thing. It won't stall. Uses the auto stop start technology. But unfortunately, it limits you from revving the engine freely in neutral. And then it has massive rev hanger to drive a manual. All right, with that said, give this thing a kind of a launch and uh see what it'll do. Ready? Little bit of a chirp. And first gear is over. First gear ends so quickly in this thing and it's hard to shift aggressively. You can feel a little bit of traction management kicking in and it bogs it a little [Music] bit. Still more fun than the auto though. Hood pop. Underneath the hood of the 2025 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road is the T24 Alpha-FTS, which is a 2.4 L dual overhead cam single turbocharged all aluminium 4-cylinder that produces 270 horsepower at 5400 RPM and 310 lb feet of torque at 2800 RPM. Despite what it looks like on camera in person, this engine doesn't look that crammed in this engine bay. There's quite a bit of room on either side of it for ease of maintenance. You'll notice the engine almost sits directly behind the front axle line, making it almost front midship. As I mentioned earlier, obviously the manual transmission version is going to have a different ECU tune than the automatic transmission version. But what's most notably different is the fact that this has a reduced engine RPM red line versus the automatic. Subsequently, also that reduces the peak horsepower output since that was achieved at a higher RPM than what the red line is. Now on the manual transmission version, the torque also comes in a little bit later in the power band and is slightly reduced than the automatic. But it's a well-known fact automatic transmissions typically have a greater parasitic loss throughout the drivetrain than a manual transmission. So, whereas this might make l",

No. Going to put this thing into sport mode. I'll run it in four high. To engage four-wheel drive, there's this little slice under the drive mode. You press the side and you can rotate it. I didn't really like this at first. It felt kind of cheap and flimsy, but I'm getting used to it. Roll forward and backwards a little bit. There we go. Now, this does not have the multi-terrain select feature because it is not an automatic transmission. You are the multi-terrain select feature. you were the robot. Traction control is defeated. It gives you a dummy light. In addition to that, there's constantly a little thing in the center of your tachometer that says traction control turned off. You can clear it and it comes right back all the time. So, it's a bit excessive, Toyota. All right, let's see what this thing can do. [Music] Ready? What? It wouldn't let me spin them in four high. You know what? I feel like the gearing makes more sense off-road already. This is This is This is nice, actually. Oh, yeah. This is a really rough section I just went through, too. That's excellent. Yeah, this thing is a absolute treat off-road. Second gear. This is a second gear champ. I can do the whole thing pretty much in second gear. This thing is quick. Oh, way way way more fun off-road than this thing is onro already. Let me get a little bit tail happy right there. The robots didn't intervene. It's so weird. I figured they could have. Man, this is no joke. Yeah. again. A little bit tail happy is feeling the tires on the dirt here. Keeping it in second gear still. Boost comes back on. Good torque.

I think this is just like the Frontier now, though, where you can't use the rear diff locker unless you're in four low. I don't know why manufacturers started doing this. Go up the more aggressive side of this. Super low in first gear. That's awesome. Oh, the manual is where it's at off-road. Tank mode. Yep. I think I just barely might have scraped a little bit right there. do have 11 inches of ground clearance, but now it doesn't have the crawl gear like you get in the seven-speed and the Bronco, which I absolutely love. And I think that's why they went with this transmission because of the first gear gearing. It kind of it's kind of trying to mimic that without having to develop a completely different transmission like Ford did. Sounds like a casino. As far as hill descent control goes, you are the hill descent control. Well, that's why I love a manual off-road proper. Kind of make sure I don't scrape right here. Good. Go down the more aggressive side of this. Yeah. Yep. Now, the manual makes a lot of sense in the taco. I wanted to criticize this thing at first after my on-road driving experience because all the robot nannies trying to make the experience of driving a manual transmission easier. And I don't think that should be a thing. I think you should require skill to operate a manual transmission, but off-road that just kind of all went away. Like I thoroughly enjoy driving this thing off-road. The double cab has more than enough leg room for a full-size adult. It's really weird that there is no armrest in the back of these. Guess you have to just lean on the person next to you. AC power inverter, two USBC's. This one has a sunroof. As far as the infotainment screen is concerned, there's a vehicle interior attached to the sides of it. It's absolutely enormous.

It literally be a modern day Back to the Future truck. And I feel a lot of diehard Toyota truck enthusiasts feel the same way, not having that configurability on those lower trim grades. The other criticism that this truck gets is for this extremely high price compared to past generations of Tacoma. And I'm not here to talk about economics cuz I suck at math. But it is expensive. and also the fact that dealerships usually only carry in inventory the loaded up higher trim grades which exasperates the problem and makes it seem like these trucks are even more unaffordable. But you still can get an SR with a manual transmission and four-wheel drive under $40,000. As far as fuel economy goes, you do take a little bit of a hit with a manual transmission on paper. Again, with a manual, it's all how you drive it. But the fact that this has a 430 final drive ratio might have a little bit something to do with it. They do offer a wide variety of colors on the Taco, which is a huge plus. I'm glad they at least do that. And I cannot praise them enough for at least still offering a manual transmission. Even if there's little faults that I can find with it, I'm still super thankful that it is at least available when most of the competitors are completely abandoning it. It is now time to give this taco some scores. Starting with the bean score, the assessment of feeling you get in your gut when you give it the beans. And it's getting a rating of followed by the cookie score, the assessment of value. And where the TRD off-road starts at 42 grand, but this one with the premium package and a couple other options added to it, bringing it to a grand total of $53,000. It gets a rating of when you add a bunch of tech features to the Taco. Yes, it gets fairly expensive, but you don't have to add all those options to ",

Welcome to this the 1974 R821 Toyota Celica ST powered by the Toyota Tundra 2Z V8 out of my dad's old pickup truck because I built this car as a surprise gift for him. Well, the car is 99% done. Basically, I just got to get this thing ready to drive now. [Music] So, I have changed the oil on this thing once already after the first 20 minutes of running. It's currently full of break-in oil from a good brand. So, being that I prefer my hair on the side of caution, I'm That was a really bad joke. Being that I like my flying saucers not attached to their belly, why are you so wobbly? I would say it's probably got over an hour of engine run time now. And right there. Oh, I forgot to take the cap off up there. It's going to be a mess coming out now. You can see a lot of the assembly lube is coming out there in lumps. Kind of like Vaseline jelly. That's normal. So, you look sampling the oil. It's got a black sheen to it. Basically, that's all too small to get captured by the oil filter. And that's predominantly from the rings as this new engine gets broken in. Thinnest tin foil ever. What the Are you kidding me? The car is on the top locks right now.

Jeez, why did I put that on so tight? Or maybe I have lube on my hands. There we go. Did it work? It worked. My little tin foil dream is perfect. All right, cuz everything has to be matchy matchy. I don't like showing the brands of the stuff I'm using because it's essentially free advertising. But I also get so many people that ask what I'm using that I'm like stuck in a rock and a hard filter. I got to stop with these punuendos. I don't even know what you want to call them.

I had just finished filming the review on it and I was driving back to the shop, not even three miles from the shop. I had my peripheral vision, I saw the oil pressure light just barely start to flicker and I was like, \"Well, maybe it's just wet cuz it's raining out and it's a wiring issue.\" But the flicker was getting a little bit more steady. So, I immediately shut the car off, pulled to the side of the road, and I got out, checked the oil, and there was nothing on the dipstick. The car had been running fantastic, hadn't given me a single issue all day, and it still sounded perfect. So, I wasn't too worried, but Angel, thankfully, was behind me. He ran to the auto parts store and grabbed some oil for it. As soon as he got back, I started adding oil to it. Put about two quarts in it, and there was still nothing on the dipstick. So, then Angel looked under the car and found the two quarts of oil. The oil drain plug was completely gone. I don't know if I bottomed out and it ripped it out, but it had a temporary rubber expandable one, I guess, that was in there. So, we went back to the auto parts store, grabbed an M14 by 1.5 drain plug, tried to put it in there, and found that the threads were completely stripped out on the pan. That's why it had that in there to begin with. So, got another one of those, put it back in there, and thankfully it held oil enough to get it back t",

Additionally, these are a little bit elongated, which allow for some more clearance. If I elongate them a bit more, I can gain some additional clearance, and I only need a couple millimeters, and I'll be good. Well, I guess the next logical thing is to try driving it. [Music] It's the following day. Decided to do this in the morning. Plug in the laptop so I can data log this. Being that I just changed the oil, I'm going to start it briefly, let it build up oil pressure, and then I'm going to recheck the oil cuz I have to fill the oil cooler. All right. Where's the hood popper? There it is. Just to be extra safe, it's got five and a/4s in it right now. I should probably open the door a little bit more cuz my legs are getting shaky. That can't be good. That is now about six quarts of oil. It's probably going to take a little bit more. It should be good. With the LS400 front sump and the oil cooler and the mount block, it takes a little over six quarts of oil. 6 and 12. Got to capture a dialogue of what happens on this first drive. [Music] I think it's just drivability I need to work out in the tune. There's people coming outside to see about that data log. I uh forgot to hit record. So uh this now it'll happen.

          "content": "[Music] The clutch is nice. It's so hard to tell if this is drive cuz everything is like spherical bearing and hard mounted him joints. So, it's going to be really harsh. So, I don't know if this is just in the tune. Try to push through it a little bit. It is. It's just in the tune. I think we'll go for second gear. [Music] That's 20 mph right there. It's driving. This drives so nice. It really does. And the suspension is not as harsh as I thought it was going to be. Definitely uh manual rack. It's nice though. It's got a lot of heft to it. I would say this went good. It's just the tune is super rough when you're trying to take off. It's very bucky. [Music] [Music] I like that the fan cycles after I shut it off. Kind of like a Audi Vub after cooler fan. I would say that is absolute mission success as far as a first drive functionality check goes. Everything seems to be operating as it should. For those of you that are not mechanically inclined or have never broken a rebuilt new engine before, I'm not going through the full rev range and I'm not giving it wide open throttle yet on this initial first drive. This is more of a functionality check to make sure everything is operating, nothing is rubbing or binding anywhere. And then once it gets on the dyno and has the tune sorted, the variable valve timing hooked up that's currently disabled, then I'll be able to start actually getting into it a little bit. But I also have to break in a new clutch as well. So with that said, the next video you see on this car, I'm going to have it on a dyno cuz there's not a whole lot left I can do to it. Then on top of that, I still got to do at least 500 miles, change oil again until the engine is broken in. So, I'm probably gonna fly my dad back out here again so he can get to drive it because by that time there's probably going to be snow on the ground in New Hampshire already and then he won't be able to drive it until next spring.

Uh well specifically I'm not sure if EV tolls are really going to be a big part of the future. The problem is we have large commercial aircraft which there's plenty of uh room to integrate developments in that space, but we also have very small drones that can scale up over time. And I think that more likely we're going to have a lot more drones in the future rather than these very specialized vehicles. Case in point, this was all the rage. Uh these uh type of vehicles such as Archamos uh FUV is a stock by the way. uh fun utility vehicles is what these were called. These were an inbetweener uh from ebikes and electric vehicles. A lot of people were excited. There were a lot of different partnerships announced, not quite as many as the EVOL space, a lot of pre-orders even and they ran into a lot of issues. One of the issues was uh and the biggest one really is just they didn't know how to scale this product. But I think they would have also run into this issue of how many people are going to want an in between product between an ebike or you know just a motorized bicycle or the full EV vehicle. Not as many as perhaps were being expected. So this company is basically no more that that play did not work. And I fear that the EV toll space might end up being that. Now I do think that there's a lot more exciting partnerships. There's the beginning of ramp up that we're seeing. uh I I think that they have a chance to be more successful on that side, but the question really remains to be seen in my mind whether this is going to be a legitimate space or not. As a result, I'm not willing to invest capital at this time. There might be a point in the future where I do invest maybe just a very very small bet with high potential of upside, but at right now I am watching from the sidelines, especially in these two companies.

Uh but it shows basically the scale the ramp up that's expected for these. So just 33 of Archer Aviation in 2026 scaling to 465. We actually will look at a slide that shows that it's going to be a lot more than that and Job's is a little bit less. You know, a lot of this is basically the way that things are designed. It's not that Joby is terrible at manufacturing. It's just they're going to run into some issues that doesn't make sense for them to scale out a whole lot on the early side while they're still in the testing and the regulatory side of things. Now, Archer Aviation has some advantages there. So, what is the big difference between these two? Well, first, if you look at the balance sheet, both of these are going to be burning cash for quite some time. They have healthy balance sheets. They'll need to do capital raises very likely in the future, but for now, they are both set. both are close to a billion dollars in cash and that's a good thing for both companies and shareholders as well. Uh that gives them runway for you about two years or so and again they will capital raise at some point. Now uh they also have a lot of partnerships between the two. Joby chose to partner of course with Toyota uh and Stalantis is the main partner as far as automotive",

And as far as uh those future partnerships too, I think the biggest way that you can tell which one of these has the lead though is which can overcome most easily the most challenging hurdle for this type of company which is the issues of scaling and manufacturing at scale. Now why do I think that Archer has an uh advantage there? Well, there's a couple of reasons. So let's look at these specifically. One of these is Palunteer. Now, Palunteer is not the end- all beall. If you partner with Palunteer, then everything that you do as a company is automatically great. No, in fact, they have partnered uh back, I believe in 2020, perhaps 2021 with Lilium. And Lilium is in this space. It's an EVOL uh company, but they are not doing well at all. So that's not specifically the reason but Palunteer specifically and also a partnership with um Anderil as well which are very specific towards automation is very good and Palanteer is actually very good. They they developed a a warp speed uh manufacturing base uh specifically that allows companies to be able to manufacture at speed and at scale and it really helps companies like this really get off the ground but also larger companies too be able to hone those sort of things and they're integrating a lot of neat tools both on the software side but really even more so uh specifically as far as uh supporting the scaling operation that they are trying to do. Now does that automatically guarantee that Archer is going to be successful? No, but I think that the other big factor is that they also are very horizontally integrated. Now, Joby is very vertically integrated and usually I prefer to invest in companies that have that vertical integration. Vertical integration, if you're not familiar with it, is basically you're building in-house as much as possible. It's not that you never partner for other things, but you're reliant on yourself. Now the advantage here for for Joby specifically is that initially yes there might be ",

          "content": "so far it's so good, but future products could certainly run into that. So why am I so convinced that horizontal is going to work here much more likely than vertical integration? Two reasons. First, ask yourself in the legacy airline industry, how many companies are vertically integrated versus horizontally? There's basically none that are vertically integrated. Now, that doesn't mean that it can't work. It just means that it really hasn't in the space. And you might say, well, you know, that that's a legacy business. That's just the way it was done back then. That doesn't have to be the way it has been done now. And that's absolutely true. You might say, \"But wait, times are different now.\" And we have a company like Tesla that's very vertically integrated. They partner where they need to, but largely they try to build it in-house, both hardware and software, and they've done that very successfully. But you have to remember Tesla nearly went bankrupt with this strategy. They came within days from actually going bankrupt and it not working out at all. And there were very very well-run, very frugally run. They ran into a lot of issues. And between timing on certain things and just grit, they were able to pull it off. But look at any other vehicle manufacturer, legacy vehicle manufacturing, also EV uh manufacturing. You do not find any other highly vertically integrated companies in the space. It just really seldomly works unless you're an absolute unicorn in this space. And I think the EV tool industry will be the same way where companies that build vertically. It sounds great in theory and if it works, man, it's fantastic, but in practicality, it's usually going to be a lot better just to build in-house what is essential, what is core to your product, and outside of that scale horizontally, which helps you be able to manufacture at scale. Why do you want to manufacture at scale? Well, at some point you need real revenue. And as you begin to build these things out an",

Now, the other thing that you need to know for Archer as far as scaling is they've partnered with Stellantis. Now, I would usually take Toyota as far as manufacturing capabilities over Stellantis, but both do okay. Now, what's interesting with Archer is about 20% of their company is owned by Stalantis. This isn't dissimilar to where Rivian was as far as Ford and Amazon partnerships. It happens uh and sometimes that's a benefit. There's also a partnership that they have with Stalantis to help aid in the manufacturing of their units where they give equity increase equity in return for uh helping them scale their manufacturing on the front end up through 2030. Now the risk for that is as that piece of the pie continues to increase by Stalantis they may get to a certain point where they say you know what we just need to acquire this company wholesale. If investors have that happen to them and that's like the worst case, that's actually usually not bad. Means you made some money, just maybe not that extreme high upside that you were hoping for.

Now, another thing that's interesting with Archer is we can see some of their recent partnerships show that they perhaps will have the lead in terms of actually launching these things off the ground, though Joby is doing fine work there. Uh this is uh from April 23rd, 2025 and Archer talked a lot about this in their previous earnings call, but specifically they were approved for UAE's first hybrid helport. Now there is a very similar deal that Joby has also in the Middle East too. Uh but this seems like it's actually going to be approved for regulation quite a bit quicker. Uh which is very key for that proof of concept. Now the other part that I thought was very interesting is this article that came out very recently here. Uh May 15th, Arch Aviation selected as the official air taxi provider of the LA28 Olympic and Parolympic Games and Team USA exclusive deal. Now, if you go back to Joby and you look at earnest calls, I believe it was from 2023, they were talking about this potentiality where they said, \"Hey, we're aiming to get this and be this partner and be able to actually showcase these at the Olympics in 2028 just because regulation and ramp up takes that long.\" And they were outmaneuvered here by Archer. Now, does that mean that Joby is doomed? Absolutely not. But it means that while uh these Olympics are going uh on Archer will be the only EV toll that's being used and because it's something relatively unique and novel people will be seeing these really for the first time in use uh a lot of people's eyeballs will get on that product which if they are successful and they need to be successful because if they're not this is about the worst thing you could do then that will breed more success in the future.

Um, and but they're doing very well there, too. So, I'm not saying Joby is a terrible investment. I'm not saying it's a terrible bet. I'm just saying that they've made things a little bit more challenging just because of their uh selection as far as vertical integration and what that means for the potential ramp up.

          "content": "Hey guys, it's Crossroads here. Today I want to talk about one of my favorite companies, my fourth largest holding, Palunteer. Palunteer has earnings that report after hours this coming Monday. So, here's what we need to know for the uh earnings and specifically they're going to probably put up the best earnings out of any company uh out of the S&P 500 this quarter. These earnings are going to shock and awe Wall Street. Let's take a quick look. So, first if we look at revenue estimates and actually just revenue in general, you can see that there's a pretty massive ramp. They actually we'll put up we'll look at their results from the last quarter. So impressive that I ended up saying, you know what, I've already taken a ton of gains on Palunteer and it's still very expensive, but I started the world's slowest DCA, which you know is looking pretty good. Palanteer is above $200 a share now. Extremely expensive as a stock. It's not cheap by any means, but it is an amazing quality company. Analysts are expecting uh $1.092 billion in terms of revenue and you can see EPS is at 17 cents. You can see the EBIT estimate there as well. A little bit less important and we can see that estimates have been going up. Now this is from fiscal AI. Uh then you can see the revisions over time as we go through. This is by the way for next year. Uh this is the current year financial year 2025. And analysts continue to revise up. Why? because Palunteer is accelerating as a business and there are some uh tells that indicate that Palunteer is likely to put up some ridiculously strong numbers. Now, what does Palanteer say? This is from their earnings slide deck in quarter two guidance in quarter three. For the third quarter 2025, we expect revenue between 1.083 billion and 1.087 billion. That's a very tight range. And adjusted income from operations is right there as well. and they have the full year guidance which uh helps us to uh just to know what to expect for quarter 4. Now, what's very i",

          "content": "crowd. Crowd Strike. Uh and then Palunteer way over here. Why? Because it's looking as far as analysts are looking at a little bit north of 40% revenue growth over the next 12 months. And also it's looking at an extreme multiple here that kind of skews this whole graph. And so, yeah, very expensive, but it's expensive for a reason. So, what exactly am I expecting as far as growth? Well, here are my expectations, my post on Xite, where I break this down, and I want to give you guys some of the same details, some different insights, too. But I'm actually expecting $1.14 billion in terms of revenue, which would be a 57% year-over-year revenue increase. That would bring it to an 18 cents EPS and also net dollar retention of 132%. So why am I so bullish when Palenter is guiding for 50%, analysts are looking at you know right around there maybe just you know 50 51 52 um which is great even if they don't hit the 57 like I'm expecting. There are three things. Now the first reason why I think that there's going to be a significant beat for Palunteer and they continue to accelerate are contracts. Contracts they are doing insanely well with right now. Uh we get a breakdown thankfully by the CFO Dan Glazer as he goes through earnings every single time and they talk about the sizing of a number of contracts specifically. Uh in this case in last quarter they had 157 deals that they closed 157 worth $1 million or more and 42 of them are worth $10 million or more. Now some of those are just massive. Some of them are right there on the nose at 10 million or 1 million. But this is a lot of contracts. Now, some are with existing companies that they'll sign additional contracts, they'll sign extensions, they'll want more product and more offering as well because this is software that actually works. It's AI that actually delivers ROI almost immediately across enterprises, which is not what most of the competitors are offering. Now, beyond those contracts, we also could see a nice glimp",

          "content": "actually there's a lot of international names, one of those weak spots, a rare weak spot for Palunteer as well. And of course, they had a lot more deals than we know of uh every single quarter it's that way. But yeah, go back to quarter two and we can see that there's massive ramp in a number of the contracts that they were signing. And so as a result of that acceleration, that's very clear on the contract side. I I think that we're going to see that in terms of revenue as well. Now, the second thing that you need to know in far as earnings and why I think it's going to be such a tremendous beat is net dollar retention. Net dollar retention is something that basically measures as a business when when you're selling as a businessto business and especially for SAS u you're keeping track of people re-upping their contracts. So, if you're somebody like a snowflake out there, ideally you to want to be putting out more and more offerings and find that your uh company that you're is pondering with you finds real value. So, they want more and more of you and your product as well. And so, each and every year they reup contracts, they add more different add-ons, and so you're continuing to make more and more money from those existing clients as you build out that relationship. Now, Palenter does it just slightly differently. Uh one thing is they measure net dollar retention not in terms of just increase from any time period but they consider you a new customer for your first year. And so if you decide like Luminar decided September they announced a partnership with Palunteer and this month in October they said you know what this is not enough uh we love Palunteer it's delivering immense ROI already uh we're going to announce a$und00 million contract extension which is very sizable. it's a big company to help them basically pivot into the direction that they're trying to go as well and they'll likely be successful. This is another chart from fiscal AI showing net dollar retent",

          "content": "And that use case that Palanteer built out immediately with AIP, it delivered real value. And so you continue to see this go up and to the right. And so I'm actually expecting that we'll see a continued step forward as well in terms of net dollar retention. I'm expecting 132% year-over-year. So if they have 132% year-over-year, uh, and and we're seeing, you know, a lot of companies are that are re-upping that are doing larger and larger contracts as well, um, it would not be too shocking to see their revenue be significantly higher than that. In this case, 57 cents. Now, there's usually a disconnect obviously between new clients that they're just signing on board and also existing clients that are upping uh through the net dollar retention. That gap is widening just because they're doing a great job at expanding and moving down the market, signing many of those contracts that are maybe worth a million or $2 million for multiple years with smaller clients. There's a lot of star startups and a startup uh cohort as well that they've been doing and vectoring towards and uh so that dollar retention is something that as those companies grow will continue to grow as well. They won't always put up 132% year-over-year but I think that it's probably likely within a percent either direction. Now the third reason why I'm thinking that this earnings is going to be particularly really really robust is the billings also known as bookings uh as it's relating to revenue as well. So, Palunteer does this within their earning slide deck. Let me pull it up. And uh what you're looking at, so usually with um SAS, especially if they have any government uh any government contracts, but even if not, you're looking at remaining performance obligations. Uh RPOS, short-term RPOS. Uh I can't remember how they define it. I think it's within the next 12 So the third reason why I'm thinking that Palunteer is going to post a ridiculous beat and accelerate nearly 60% year-over-year is because of the ",

And you can see again here there's clear acceleration in terms of billings. If we look at this on a chart I put by the way on yellow right here this is revenue and then blue is billings. Billings is basically when Palanteer is at the point like okay you guys have been using our product you owe us some money here you go here's a bill little bit more to it but in essence think of that uh that is a clear indicator of where revenue is in the future. Now I do want to throw this out there that you can see here. So if you bill for things in a quarter, the next quarter usually there are are exceptions you will see that in terms of revenue back in 2023 there were twers in a row where billings actually uh was higher than where we were with total revenue. But part of that was macroeconomic conditions at the time with some of these companies uh as they were trying to accelerate in vector and try to figure out AI. Uh but we can see that there was other times again here this is September 2024 so a year ago that the billings were incredibly high they spiked up and then the actual revenue that next quarter was very slightly higher less than 1%. In fact that's happened twice right here 718 to 725 as well. So I'm actually not predicting uh or I'm not sure that we'll see revenue at 1.102 billion. Again my number is right here 1.14 billion. So, I'm a little bit north of that. We might be just a little bit south of that as well. Either way though, this is showing a number that is likely going to indicate a higher number than what analysts are expecting, what Palanteer has guided for us as well. There's a strong correlation there, a strong history as well. And the comments that were on the earnings call seem to indicate and reflect this acceleration also with what we got in quarter 2. So, now beyond this, what am I looking for in this quarter out of Palunteer? One is of cou",

I'll throw this up real quick just so you can see. Rule of 40 enterprise software companies with over 1 billion in revenue. There we are right there. And by the way, here is Nvidia from last quarter. I hope they do more slides like this. But I'm I'm very curious as far as uh long-term plans and strategies, what they're seeing as far as their business. They're ver very early in on this as well, but oftentimes Alex Karp will make some comments as far as where they're at versus where they're going over the next five to 10 years. I'd love to hear more of that as well. I have a lot of conviction that there's a lot of upside in this company. The stock though is one of those things where it's very expensive, very expensive for a good reason, but it is not cheap at all. Not nearly as expensive as many people think because again, when you're growing at a 57% or let's just say 50% year-over-year revenue growth and you're talking about billions of dollars, you are doing something incredibly well. You're on an island. So, love to see them continue to do that. Anyway, regardless, it's going to be an amazing quarter. It's a great time to be a Palunteer shareholder. The stock just does great or the company does great and the stock collapses. That's a beautiful thing. I will add a lot more shares. And if it just keeps going up and setting new all-time highs, can't really complain about that either. Anyway, I'm being very careful with my covered calls this week because I I remember history and I don't want to get my last uh few shares uh to be burned by selling a few covered calls out there.

This is one uh and I'll go through the numbers here in just a minute that I think will be similar in a lot of respects with quarter 2 with two significant changes. Uh but I don't know that it will be enough to capture the market's attention. I'm kind of expecting the stock might move up or down, you know, a little bit, but it's not going to be a massive movement.

But let's take a quick look at my numbers and then we'll talk about some of the things that I'm looking for as well. So this is just a draft of what I'll be rolling out as far as earnings predictions here shortly. But the numbers are good and verifiable. So I'm expecting them to have actually a 6.4% revenue increase year-over-year. And as a part of that, you can see branded growth is at 5% year-over-year. And we also have transaction margin dollars at about 6% year-over-year, $3.85 billion. If you look at quarter two uh their report where they increased guidance uh you can see that this is actually a little bit north but not too much north of what they were projecting for transaction margin dollars and also for revenue as well. So uh there's a couple of uh other numbers that we'll look at here and then we'll get into the breakdown. EPS of $1.3 uh which is above analyst estimates. The revenue is by the way above as well.

There's a lot of positives, too. And so, let's look at some of those positive revenue drivers. This is one of those and one of the reasons why, by the way, I think quarter 4 will be a much more robust quarter. Uh, not just for revenue, but also for a number of factors. Um, this they didn't give us exact numbers for Brainree and what they're expecting here. They had four more comments though um in the the earnings transcript and also the fireside but in essence we see brain tree headwinds which again is was intentional that back here they were like in growth at all cost mode even if it didn't translate to the bottom line and Alex Christen team said hey that doesn't make sense let's take higher take rate let's not do a race to the bottom uh in return to we'll lose some volume not as much as they expected but that was certainly a drag here in the fourth quarter last year all the way through and So they they could have a harder comp here in regards to that, although we do see some reaceleration from Brainree.

          "content": "hedging unless they're seeing something in the near future that uh companies tend to do, including PayPal. So that is certainly a benefit as well. Omni channel continues to go well in Germany. Uh there was a report uh that came out uh earlier in the month that indicated that five million people in Germany, 6% of the population there I believe had already gotten a debit card from PayPal. Now why is that a big deal? Mostly PayPal is online. It dominates e-commerce and other transactions in Germany, but they don't do much in the terms of omni channel push. This was a big push and roll out since May. And so those are frankly incredible numbers. Uh and the early read is that that's going to continue to increase transaction um volume and also overall revenue too. Uh so that's a great factor as well. There's a number of other initiatives that they're rolling out which I won't break into too much. Some of them are just a little bit too early to make a massive difference in revenue, but a lot of these are creative. The vaulted experiences, PayPal complete payments rolling out globally, a little bit of ad revenue that you mix in there as well. uh omni channel here in the United States, Vinmo monetization, a lot of stuff. And this is uh I think overall we're going to see a little bit more acceleration on the revenue side rather than uh what they guided for which was you know looking at maybe 5% overall growth as well. Now Brandon transactions are at 5% year-over-year and this I think is one of the reasons why PayPal may not move a lot at terms of a stock because we've seen similar numbers in quarter 2. They actually posted a triple beat and it was a really strong beat not only over their own guidance but also over analyst expectations and yet the stock tanked. It did. It was actually pretty surprising given the expectations and given how low that PayPal was already trading and the only thing that I could really isolate there at the time. Now this is of course my projections fr",

          "content": "most analysts are expecting flat year-over-year not year-over-year but quarter over-arter sequential growth in terms of revenue partly because of these headwinds. And I just think that they're wrong. I think that they're being overly conservative. Is that remarkably different than my numbers? No. EPS is actually really low, 1.2 instead of 1.3, which would be fairly surprising. So, they're going to beat these estimates, but it may not be enough. So, I want to look at free cash flow here. Uh, that's the one factor that I think that will be very interesting. So, PayPal in their own guidance, let's actually pull up this guidance here. We can see that they reiterated free cash flow of between six to 7 billion. Um, that stayed the same. a lot of other things where it stood stayed the same or actually increased or improved in this case right here. Um now we can see what the free cash flow uh let's close this out uh was uh in the prior quarter. Now part of this was timing benefits of PayPal working capital which means that we'll receive we'll see some of what should have been free cash flow in quarter two otherwise in quarter three. This can be very lumpy as you can see quarter over quarter. Sometimes there's really good reasons for this. Like again, this should not have been as high and this should not have been as low except for timing benefits from selling buy now pay later products to KKR. Um, some of that, by the way, will hit in quarter 3 as well. PayPal announced a contract with Blue Capital to basically sell some of their buy now pay later uh paying for loans to Blue, which basically means uh that they're accelerating buy now pay later. We already know that though. Uh so anyway, if you add these two together, you're a little bit over $1.5 billion. And going back to their guidance, they're again saying six to seven billion. So if we take them, we made way point on there, we're looking at around $5 billion of free cash flow over the next two quarters. So I'm expecting",

          "content": "there's a couple other smaller parts, is buybacks. PayPal stock has been abysmal in terms of price action. But the nice thing is a silver lining is although I I do wish it was going up, believe me, uh is that they're spending $ 1.5 billion dollars each quarter on buybacks, which uh of course the lower the share price is, the more shares that they do end up buying back. And as a result, that improves and boosts EPS over time. Now, there's a couple of other margin factors that I think that they'll actually produce just a little bit higher uh of the gross margins as well, which factors into this. Branded experiences also help too. So, I think that we'll see that up. Now the other kind of wildcard factor is not so much guidance. I think that they probably will increase guidance slightly for the end of the year but is active users as well. So if we look at active users actually let's pull that up here into their um their earnings deck and this is right here. You can see active users for a while. Uh they were actually losing accounts and at the time back in 2023, you know, they they guided for this. They they said what was going on. In essence, under Dan Schulman, they were like, \"Hey, let's pay people to use our product and then maybe at some point in the future we won't have to do that.\" Sometimes, honestly, that's not the worst strategy. And there can be times to absolutely do that uh and scale and then monetize. Didn't work out for them. And so as a result they pivoted away from basically paying people to use their product to a uh beneficial strategy that you know they they lost some accounts there but they gained accounts that actually contribute to that bottom line. Now you don't see a huge amount of acceleration. Most of that is these are the law it's a law of large numbers. when you're talking about 438 million people, that's a lot of people. But because of some channel partnerships that they're doing and as Fast Lane continues to get pushed out, uh because of wha",

And so my guess again for this quarter is it will be a very good solid quarter, a triple beat that will not excite the market just because that topline revenue and branded are not there yet and there's not a meaningful read yet on guidance especially for these new products next year. We may have some early reads and I hope that we do definitely need to have those in quarter 4 earnings in January as we look at the next year. But for now I think this might be one of those quarters where the market takes a look at PayPal and says, \"Yeah, it's fine. Let's see you next quarter. And uh that's where I am with PayPal. So regardless, let me know what you think in the comments. Is there something that I'm overlooking that's a major factor in earnings this quarter? And do you think that quarter 4 is that for quarter where we'll see that beginning of that real acceleration ramp uh through a variety of factors that we talked about today?

There are two new positions in my portfolio from last time and my cash position has been reduced. My cash and swing position dramatically as you're going to see in just a moment. I want to show you what I've deployed into and we're going to go through each of these holdings and I'll talk a little bit about them and what I've been doing in my portfolio. All right, so first this is the breakdown. You can see that this is the allocation here that some of these are quite heavy allocations and also this is in my other portfolio but I'm about 5% in my crypto 2.1% cash so I do have some cash remaining uh but for the most part it has been deployed versus last time that uh this was allocated more towards half of the size of crypto. I've added Ethereum essentially since that. That's a change there. Uh and I've reduced cash by quite a bit deploying this. I also had a large swing position which we're going to talk about in a minute. So the two new positions uh without further ado are these two right here and these are all the stocks in my portfolio and I'll show you where each of these line up. So the first of these is Bitmine. Bit mine is one of these that is not a uh really a quarter position. I could technically just leave it in my swing portfolio, but to be honest this is a longer term swing. I'm looking at at least two years for Bitmine and holding Bitbine and so it's at 10% allocation right now which is about the size of what I allow myself to do as far as a swing portfolio. Now technically with Bitmine it's not all shares mostly shares uh but I also have some vertical spreads have a little bit of BMU there that I'm just lumping in. It's just a tiny bit though. Uh one literally one put. So, uh, and I've also been buying shares of BMR that I plan to hold, uh, probably long-term or I might convert them at some point to Ethereum, uh, with just the premiums.

I do think it's going to be probably a two quarters before we see meaningful revenue acceleration.

If it falls under 22 and lower I'm actually willing to add there as well up to about 10% allocation. Normally I do that for micro caps but this is a little bit unusual one.

My allocation for Robin Hood was something around 5%.

Uh but I have decided uh last quarter based on the strength of that the clear acceleration I think this is going to be another tremendous quarter for them as well to just do the world's slowest DCA. So this means that I'm adding shares in the single digits periodically. Not massive buys at all but I figured I'll go ahead and start that trickle DCA. And of course, if the stock price does collapse and nothing else has really changed, I'm happy to double even triple this position.

Uh but that's uh we don't know where it's accelerating from, but I get the idea that that's pretty meaningful acceleration otherwise they would put it out like that and I think probably in this quarter they'll let us know where it was currently. That'll make this data point more relevant as well. Now what I have not liked of course is the slowing uh core revenue. It did slow and technically they kind of missed their own guidance uh uh for the first time ever uh in the previous quarter at least the way that I'm looking at this. Um I I see this more as a next year type of play. And so I've not added anything to my HIMS position. In fact, it's underperformed most of the rest of my portfolio. And so it's actually under uh two and a half percent simply because of that underperformance. I'm just happy to hold here. And uh will I add to him? Yeah, if the price keeps falling down or we get to next here and uh I I see that this uh core revenue acceleration really is happening with testosterone uh with these menopause products and also what they're doing in Canada, also with Zava as well.

Also really didn't care for the CEO re uh retweeting another uh creator and saying uh basically that he was talking about a short squeeze. I I don't like my CEOs talking about that.

I should have mentioned that as well. Um Nvidia is just it's at the core and central to the AI wave which is very legitimate. I don't know that many people are still saying it's all smoke and mirrors. Now there's a lot of uh cir circular um revenue that's given. Uh for instance, uh Nvidia recently marked a deal with OpenAI. With OpenAI, they're like, \"Okay, you we're going to sell you all these different products.\" OpenAI is like, \"Well, we don't have the money for that. So, take some of our company instead.\" And so, for each lot of uh units that are actually deployed in the data center, then OpenAI also gives Nvidia in addition to revenue, a chunk of their company as well. Compare that to AMD. Now, I'm not bearish AMD. I like Lisa Sue. I have friends that are in AMD and I think they'll do fine. I think that they're a solid second uh choice and they've done really well over the last six months too. So very happy for uh my retail shareholders there. Uh but AMD had a similar deal with OpenAI but it shows the weakness of their product relative to the premium that Nvidia is able to command. Case in point there AMD had to give up a part of their company in order for OpenAI to actually buy uh their product line. So that's it's just it is a weaker footing and so Nvidia I don't think is going to be the best performer in my portfolio but they are just a solid anchor.

Now, why would I suddenly reverse course? Well, one is this is a swing trade for me. And when I'm presented with new data, that's when I evaluate. And if something changes in the thesis, if there's more risk or more opportunity, I pivot according to that. I've been talking with some of the other guys. Uh, Teevis, of course, has a great video out. I'm actually going to link that below. Uh, Chris Patel and others as well, and they have similar concerns. This was actually brought to us by a couple of commenters on X. What happened? And and why am I reconsidering Weeble? What are the risks? Why do I find this weird? Let's take a look. So, this is what was announced after hours on Thursday. Of course, the market closed a little bit earlier. is in essence uh Weeble said, \"Okay, we're going to do an equity race.\" And uh what they're looking to do is use Yorkville right here. And so the way that this basically works, you can read this, by the way, on the SEC uh website as well. And I encourage you to do so anytime you're invested in a company. Always pull up these documents always will have a lot more detail. Uh this basically gives them future credit. Uh so in essence, Yorkville is a third party that there is is being tasked by Weeble uh to sell up to a billion dollars worth of the dilution of a little bit less than 5% of the market cap of Weeble. So not massive and it can be used for an array of things in the future including acquisitions, strategic moves, that sort of thing. Um what's kind of interesting about it is they're not obligated to do this. In other words, they have basically until 2028 uh to just tell this company Yorkville like, \"Hey, we'd like you to sell this amount of shares.\" And they'll do that. So, it gives them a lot of flexibility. I don't have a big issue with that except there",

          "content": "of them. Of course that's what they do. Uh, so why Weeble? That's my question is why would Weeble do this? I don't understand. Even Newsmax is not profitable yet. Weeble, well, let's look at the some of the numbers here. We see net income is actually in the positive and cash and debt. No, this is not the best and most recent data, but they don't have debt and they have almost a billion dollars worth of cash. There's actually a little bit more than that, which is Weeble's cash. They they retired some warrants recently as well. Like things looked really good. I love companies that are generating cash that are about to be fully year profitable um that are growing that are accelerating. That's one of the things I found interesting about Weeble. And then they turn around and do this. Now, I don't mind dilution if there's a reason for it, but there's a lot of other things that they could do. They could, for instance, do a mixed shelf offering. A mix shelf offering is something that uh a lot of companies will do when they want flexibility in the future whether that's for future acquisitions or anything else including sometimes which I don't really like uh buying back their stock aggressively. That's not what hap is happening here but Lululemon was one of those that recently announced a mix shelf offering. Doesn't mean that there's going to be a dilution. It just gives them flexibility usually over a three-year period of time. That's a pretty standard deal. Uh usually the market initially doesn't like it. uh and then it just levels out after that. No big deal. Um they could have done a revolving credit facility if for some reason they felt like in the short term just because uh they didn't have enough cash there. It wasn't necessarily for an acquisition. They could and it's very common for massive companies to do this and even smaller companies where they go and they say hey we want basically it's a corporate credit card of a certain amount that they can use for anything in",

Robin Hood did this uh shortly after their IPO as well. It's one of the reasons why they have a lot of uh money on their balance sheet and no debt at all. And the last thing that they could have done is senior convertible notes. Now, there's a lot of other options, too, by the way. they would just be a little bit less compelling. But senior convertible notes basically is offering uh future ownership of the company depending on a certain future strike price of said company. We've seen this, you know, with a lot of companies this year, especially since rates are higher. Uh especially when they're trying to retire some sort of revolving debt. Uh SoFi did this, of course, uh infamously last year. The market didn't like it, but a lot of times when senior convertible notes are offered, it's just kind of a nothing burger. market doesn't overreact or react crazy. Maybe there's a little bit of selling pressure, but it's something that's out in the future and usually it's a small amount. But instead, they said, \"Hey, let's keep options open. Let's give ourselves flexibility, which again, a mix shelf offering would have provided, and let's also lose 2.5%.\" Now, why would they have done this? It's hard to say. We don't know for sure. We see what the announcement is, and it is in the SEC filings as well. But one reason if a smaller, newer, profitable company might do this is they might say, \"Okay, we just don't have the acumen in-house to be able to effectively sell our stock, be able to fill out everything we need with the SEC, be able to time the market as far as the sells.\" It'd be a pretty dumb reason. But what makes it especially more dumb is it's Weeble. This is a company whose bread and butter really is being a brokerage. They have people there that know what they're doing in regards to the SEC.

But it could be that there is a uh attempt to do a hostile takeover or Weeble that they don't want to become acquired by another company and yet somebody is trying to acquire them. Now, usually the way this works is you'll see people ratchet up their ownership and at a certain amount of ownership they have to disclose but there's a lag between when that ownership hits that threshold and when it actually needs to be disclosed. So if there has been somebody whether it's a company or individual that is ratcheting up shares that hasn't been disclosed yet that is looking to buy Weeble and do a hostile takeover even though they don't want to sell that could be that they're turning to this as a poison pill. In that sort of environment, especially when there's activist investors that are in there that are trying to do that hostile takeover, companies oftentimes will dilute themselves forcibly, making it so that the float is so much larger and it's so much harder to take over. Stock price action usually doesn't like it. It's a terrible option. That's why it's called a poison bill. But man, I don't like that as a shareholder either. So, they could be distressed. They could be desperate. They could also be dumb. Now, that might be a little bit unfair, but you look at all those other different options of what they could be doing right now to do a capital raise. And to me, they all look more compelling than what they're doing right now. I don't understand why they were doing this. I don't know what it's for. I don't like that as an investor.

Today I wanted to give a quick BitMine update and also talk about how Bitmine and Micro Strategy MSTR ticker are quite quite different plays beyond the obvious that one is more in Bitcoin, the other is Ethereum as well. So, let's take a look now. First, let's take a look at this update right here. Uh, BitMine provides these updates on a weekly basis and they talk about what they've been doing over the last week. Now, we had indication over the weekend that Bitmine had gone after the dip in Ethereum quite heavily. And of course, there's we don't know for sure. Some of the wallet addresses are just speculation whether they're tied to Bitmine or not. But this seems like it's more uh confirmation of this. So, they're over 3 million Ethereum at this point, which the goal is around 6 million and some change to hit that 5% goal. Now, of course, they'll overshoot it by a little bit at least, and they've talked about going up to per potentially as much as 10%. Uh, they still have some cash, and I'm glad that they do have some, but a lot of what they were using ended up getting deployed towards Ethereum. Uh, we don't know how many share count that they have as well. So, BMR rocks, which is just an estimate. Um they basically uh look at uh past history as far as Bitmine buys, the size of the buys as well to estimate the amount of dilution and we're looking at an MNAP possibly around 1.41x. Now we don't know uh whether or not I should probably just start subscribing to them by the way. This is a nice product. We don't know whether or not this number is accurate uh but uh you know it's probably it it seems like it is positive MNAV that's over that one level. uh if it's in the 1.3s that doesn't bother me much. 1.2 is when it starts getting a little bit compressed and there doesn't have quite that advantage that they have to traditionally to be able to sell their shares and buy Ethereum. So, um this will be something to see uh of course once BMR act",

          "content": "This looks just like stair steps. Now, why is it a stair step like this? Well, in reality, it's not. They're buying all the time tactically for these dips, but this is just showing that weekly reporting number as well. We can contrast this with ESP, which hasn't grown meaningfully. Now, uh, a lot of this was just from staking volume. They ran out of gas and when you're trading under MNAV, it's dilutive and so they don't do it. We see this as well with ETHM and also the other players as well. just one is acquiring a massive market share which again brings more institutional volume which again helps all aspects of what they're doing. We can see the trading volume as well which is something that they continue to site time and time again as far as the liquidity. Um well I know it was in their press right here. Yeah, volatility and liquidity. So uh Tom Lee said volatility creates deleveraging and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals or as we say substantial discount to the future and this creates advantage for investors at the expense of traders and of course this is something that uh has been an advantage as well for Bitmine just to be able to use this. Now Tom Lee did present at uh recent uh conference uh in Singapore and so they've given a kind of an updated investor perspectus uh this month. Not too much different there. There's been some updated numbers of course, but there's also a very interesting interview with Tom Lee which highlights probably the most significant difference. Now, if you're not familiar with MSTR, Micro Strategy or now just strategy and Bitmine in essence uh Micro Strategy uh run by Sailor is uh focused on Bitcoin. That's it. Bitcoin is a Bitcoin maximalist and that's played out well for them. They've run up a lot more of course than the cost of Bitcoin as well. And also at the same time uh they've uh made it so that digital asset strategy looks like it is a real winner as long as you can capture that market sh",

          "content": "since that's their goal. Uh just to avoid dropping down and causing some noise. Oh no, they only have 4.98% or something silly like that. Um the other big thing with Ethereum is it's really being utilized for a lot of real projects in the web 3 world and also some in real world Kmart as well. There's a lot of level twos built on top of Ethereum. Again, this is partly a stable coin play where over 50% of stable coin volume is on Ethereum and it's just a lot of things. I won't go into all those right there, but uh because of the different strategy. So, with Michael Sailor, the way that they acquire more Bitcoin is by going into debt. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. We can see right here though that their cash and debt, their debt is meaningfully higher than it was before. actually think that this number might be a little bit overstated on here, but it's they have debt and they don't have cash, but what they do have, even though I'm not a Micro Strategy shareholder, I do want to give them credit. They have Bitcoin. So, it's not like that they just have a whole bunch of debt and no real assets. That's not what's going on here. Instead, it's this idea of fiat currency. Uh that United States is a fiat currency. It's not backed by anything. And as a result, Michael Sailor sees that over time, this becomes more and more worthless. Not that it's worthless now. Obviously, it has worth because even if you're a Bitcoin maximalist, you can buy Bitcoin. So, it has value. Uh but over time, of course, inflation eats away at the purchasing power of this versus it's the opposite of Bitcoin. And so, he sees a depreciating asset of cash and he sees an appreciating asset of Bitcoin and as a result sells the cash uh and buys Bitcoin as well. So over the long term it'll make sense but there is some risk and basically when they are using balance sheet leverage like this and going into debt there is a risk of a liquidity event. Now, we didn't go anywhere near close to t",

          "content": "Taking a page from Jamie Diamond's playbook, you know, in to large holders have a responsibility to have a super clean balance sheet and that's a first principle of Bitmine. I think most people I know in crypto do not use leverage because they've lived through those systematic draw downs. So I think most people who have a lot of experience uh avoid leverage. Of course, Micro Strategy is an exception there, but it doesn't mean what they're doing is wrong or it won't work out. Just that there's some more risk there as well. So, Ethereum uh it can collapse uh and do one of these massive wick downs where it goes it's not going to do this or very unlikely. you know, if Ethereum goes down 99% on a single dip for whatever reason and then it was some silly thing and it's resolved and it goes back up mostly where it was before, that would cause a lot of people that are uh leveraged to be liquidated. It would be very painful, awful, and terrible for the ecosystem. Uh but for Bitmine, it makes no difference. Now, Ethereum going down is not good. Uh even if it's a wick down, but for them, it's an opportunity rather than an exposure to an immense amount of risk. So that really is the significant difference between the strategy of strategy micro strategy MSTR uh which they're called strategy now uh and also Bitmine is that risk of course Bitmine as well is mostly focused on Ethereum. They do have some Bitcoin. They do have some Bitcoin minor equipment stuff too but most of who they are is focused very much on Ethereum and so that's I think the best way that we should perceive it. So regardless this is a great update. It's great to see this level of conviction for Bitmine that they continue to buy and hold and add a number of uh Ethereum tokens. Uh they still do need to figure out the staking stuff and you know before the end of the year that needs to be done. But I appreciate these updates. I'm glad that it's a play where even if you're having these massive wick down events that ",

          "content": "Hey guys, it's Crossroads here. Today I wanted to talk to you about Hims and Hurst, ticker symbol HIMS, and give an update as there's been three big big pieces of bullish news that have dropped over the past two weeks. And it's important that we as investors consider and talk about them even though there are some short-term bearish things to consider as well. Let's take a look. So the first of these is this announcement that happened on July 9th. Hims and Hers announces planned 2026 expansion to Canada following Zava acquisition completion. Of course, Zava is uh an expansion into basically the healthcare uh platform in Europe itself and we'll have to see how that goes. But it sounds like at least rumors are that they got a pretty decent price on that which I'm excited about. But specifically, this announcement talked about entering Canada specifically mentioning semiglutide a number of times. Now, if you've been following him and hers, of course, simaglutide here in the United States has gone off the shortage list and they can no longer sell it under the 503b shortage list exception only 503A for uh if there are as a medical necessity and on a much smaller dose and batch typically. And so why in the world would they announce this for January or probably January 5th or thereafter in Canada? And it specifically has to do with something that Nor Vodorisk did or rather didn't do. Now, I won't show you the whole story here. This is well worth a read though because it's hilarious. Um, but this is from Market Watch. The story of how Novo Nordisk will lose billions because it didn't pay a couple of hundred. And that refers to basically what happened with Canada. Canada patent law requires the company to re-up their patent every once in a while. They didn't do it. I think it was something like $250. I don't know if it's Canadian or US, doesn't really matter. And so they were sent notification and warning and there was also a fine attached to it because they were paying it la",

          "content": "more is this right here. uh specifically they announced that they were unlocking the next level of personalized health care with HIMS athome testing offers. So they did made a uh small acquisition in the past with inhome test kits and I expect that this is at least a piece of what they're launching. This isn't fully launched yet but we do see a glimpse of these inhome tests which are still in the United States but a little bit more rare than perhaps other parts of the world. And basically you can run a test for many different types of treatments. And so we look here from heart health to kidney health, liver health, cancer detection, pancreas health, sexual health, stress and aging, male and female health, thyroid health, nutrients and electrite lights. This is an interesting product, especially the way that HIMS launches it, the way that HIMS actually goes about this as well. Now, we don't know the pricing. It says affordable pricing, uh, but we'll have to see what this actually looks like. And it says, \"Our cutting edge facility in New Jersey will process blood tests at affordable prices for HIMS and Herb sub subscribers using state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment.\" So, this is very much to do with that small acquisition that they did. Uh, they tend to handle acquisitions quite well. And so, um, we'll see what the price point looks like, but it wouldn't surprise me if the way that Hims and Hers actually uses this is as a bit of a loss leader. So, uh, for example, if the actual kit, and we see some kits that are priced out there between the $200 and $400 range, uh, from other providers, perhaps HIMS is willing to take a loss on that. So, it actually costs them to process maybe 200 bucks. Maybe they sell this for $100. So, there is some cost to it. People aren't just signing it up that aren't uh really seeking care. But the reason why HIMS may want to do this is if somebody for my instance myself, this might be the first HMS and Earth product that I actually use. I I",

I a lot of things at HMS drops, for instance, the gummy that they dropped a few weeks ago, not even going to talk about it much. I'm like, hey, it's a nice product. They they've added it. That's nice. They'll do that along the way. Not a big deal. This this fills up that flywheel massively, and I think it could be a very big deal. We'll have to see what that looks like. Now, the other piece of news that I thought was really interesting and also bullish, this article, not so much, but there's a piece to it. Uh, Washington Post had an exclusive that said the unlikely pact and breakup of a drug maker and telealth star. And so, they interviewed a lot of people on basically both sides of this conflict. But the CEO of him and hers is actually uh, you know, a large person that they talked to and specifically. And one of those things that uh was quoted here, this is from him's house on X uh but I wanted to bring this up because he captured the article. He mentioned this is it said that they met for a couple of hours with Moore and his leadership team uh and directly raised the biggest point of friction according to Dudum. Himsenhurst planned to continue offering personalized doses of compounded simaglutide under regulation that's 503A pharmacy exception. And while they didn't like it and they weren't excited about it, dissatisfaction right there, they didn't talk about dropping uh this alto together. And instead, they even talked about partnering on a future project as well. So, the CEO specifically said, \"Yeah, he he's open to a partnership in the future.\" We'll see where that goes. To me, this illustrates that perhaps there's a little bit less risk for a lawsuit from Nova Nordisk. We'll have to see. And I think I think it might be sometime after quarter 2 earnings drops here in August uh for us to really know that for sure. I think there is a risk if they're doing a lot of",

          "content": "video on this and I talked about taking some off the table. It had been a big runner for me uh just because of that lawsuit risk which I thought was forthcoming. It has not dropped yet and I think it's a little bit less likely now. I still think quarter two might be a challenge. Uh they did guide for sequential drop in terms of revenue and sometimes the market can be a little bit stupid and not understand even though it should know this and her said that this was h was happening as a result of moving off that shortage list and not being able to have that full quarter of that compounded simlutide the way that they would do it in the past. So if they show a massive revenue spike and increase I think the lawsuit risk goes up. If they show uh less revenue than expected, that's also a challenge. So, it might be one of those just challenging no- win quarters. Nevertheless, they're more than just weight loss. There's a lot of aspects to this company, that flywheel just gets stronger and stronger as does the differentiation. And really, as they bring a lot of people here, this is one thing I didn't mention and talk about, but with that in-home testing kit, that gives them a lot more customers, that gives them a lot more data as well to work with. And so those inferences from MedMatch continue to get better and better and stronger and stronger as time goes on. So I think that's the reason why the stock is running besides everything being a little bit bullish at this point. I did add some and hers uh this morning when we opened up as far as the market actually maybe just a little bit before the opening. Uh I was excited to do so especially with this testing. Uh I think that's going to be an an incredible addition. So beyond that I continue to sell some cash secured puts on him. If it falls there, great. If it doesn't, I still have a position. I'll continue to have a position as well for a long time. Uh, but we'll have to see where the stock goes. It tends to be very volatile ",

I knew that I I really liked investing in stock picking, but um my I mean I I I kind of dabbled. I I my my my major in undergrad was called general studies. So real just take whatever you want. And so took a lot of econ classes, almost almost finished that degree and then decided I didn't want to do econ. So basically what I'm trying to say is finished undergrad with a degree that wasn't really conducive to um quick progress and and quick upward mobility within finance. Um so uh from there I went to grad school. I got my masters in finance from Michigan. Um then started working for a registered investment adviser um and MLY. So kind of a busy period in my life for it was probably around grad school started in 2019. Then pandemic hit and and MLYU and uh MLYU and the RA were during the pandemic. Um so RA wasn't great at giving remote work. Uh kind of an old school shop uh but had met a lot of people, learned a lot of stuff, great resources. Uh just was was more manual um paper based. Um so wasn't getting a lot of work from them. Mly full again loved my time there. um maybe some cultural differences with me wanting to title a bit differently and not um and and maybe cater to a different crowd. So, uh from as I was doing all that was building the Twitter audience, people like Brian Faldi were super helpful and instrumental and um giving me a critical base to talk to uh to grow from there.

Yeah, I I you know, I kind of well maybe I kind of did the opposite of what probably a lot of people do. I was very much so a valueoriented investor and um a bargain hunter. I think Boeing was like my largest position um in five years ago. U so to give you an idea, Boeing is not that's not the type of company I really invest in or or approach anymore. Um and and and I think it it started off with a very basic understanding of financial statements um with just revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income um and and just understanding those concepts and what they mean but not understanding the intricate weird sometimes counterintuitive rules of gap accounting and how that can frequently throw off a metric from a from quarter to quarter.

Step two is is un and and I guess step two and three and four are taking several years to understand well that doesn't look right. Um what it should look like.

You forget about it. And you put things in context very very well. You know, not more than just year-over-year too. to show trends of where it might be going, what what's happening, like a a very detailed breakdown. And uh yeah, I enjoy usually even companies that I follow in great detail, there are things that you pick out that I'm like, \"Oh, I didn't I didn't notice that or I didn't think about it that way.\" So, thank you. And I mean, selfishly, I I cover about 50 companies, maybe a few less than that in a newsletter. So, and and I only own 20 of them. So, and the other 30, some of them are dictated by everyone in the world wants to know about this company, but most of them are dictated by I'm kind of considering this and it it's close and and it it might be an interesting part of the portfolio at some point. So, just really gives me um an ability to react to to real-time news and price fluctuations because I think I think understanding when to take advantage of that and when not to take advantage of that and also understanding that our decision there is going to be wrong sometimes. But maximizing the likelihood of it being correct is based on having a just a really firm intricate and I know you know this, but a firm intricate knowledge of of fundamental health. And so if a stock falls 50% but the company's killing it and and earnings are are continuing to grow and revenue is accelerating, that's an opportunity. But if that's not happening, then maybe it's not an opportunity.

Um, and I mean he's just he's so and I some people are going to think that I'm criticizing him when I say this, but I'm not. He is such a phenomenal storyteller for his company and such a phenomenal figure and face to drive that narrative. And and I mean he's that that has that has netted Tesla a massive premium for a very very long time. Um, and even when um, you're seeing things about, um, Austin maybe having a few issues and being geoenced and being a very limited launch, I'm still being able to create the kind of excitement and drive and and passion within his investor base to to continue that narrative.

Uh what are your thoughts on Google and what and if you're bullish uh why do you think that the market what do you think the market's missing or is the market missing something on Google? Um I I think the the there's a very key idea in Genaii models and in Genti models and and and them being better than the other 10 on the market and that's the data inputs that that that train those models and and eventually drive inference and reasoning. Um and no I mean at Google has six products with distribution to two billion people. They have a ton of a ton of web browser data. They have a ton of search data. They have a ton of video data through through Google cloud. They have a ton of cloud workload data.

May maybe you could you could argue Meta rivals them um a little bit in that regard, but um OpenAI certainly doesn't rival them there and Anthropic certainly which is which Google is a large investor in doesn't doesn't rival them in that regard.

It's it it's funny but um it's it's it's Venmo monetization and we've seen so many anecdotes about pay with Venmo growth accelerating about debit card usage accelerating um these new college co-branded cards that they're rolling out. I I think if you think about what Venmo's demographic is, it's that um that that's when they get people in their ecosystem. So, not having that before now. I know it looks simple and it it's it's aesthetic and and it's it's surface level, but I do think it's actually important. Um but but I mean, he's he's given that Chris has given the stat. Um it's I I really quick anecdote on on on all the earnings transcripts, it always says James Chris instead of Alex Chris. Yeah. So I I reached out to him and I feel like an idiot for this, but I said, \"You should tell all these people that your name is Alex.\" He's like, \"My legal name is actually James.\" Like, \"Oh my god, I'm such an idiot.\" But um but um so where where I was was Venmo monetization ramping extremely extremely nicely. And then Brainree, which has been a phenomenal revenue growth driver, but a large drag on and and I and as listeners, as I'm saying all this, he knows everything that I'm saying. So there's things that I overlook even on PayPal that you you pull out. I'm like, \"Oh, yeah. I didn't I didn't notice that.

Just doing a quick earnings preview on each of them. I'm not sure I'll have time to do a full review of on any of these. I'd hope to do PayPal, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that or Palunteer. It's been an exceptionally busy time. So, your time is valuable. So, let's go and do a quick overview. So, the first of these is PayPal. PayPal is coming up April 29th in the pre-market also at the same time as SoFi uh which we'll talk about next. How will they do? Well, I think that they're going to meet on revenue uh and actually beat on EPS slightly. This isn't going to be exciting quarter as far as a topline numbers, but there are a couple of things that are pretty exciting. So, one of those is active accounts. Now, active accounts is not the most important measure. Usually, if PayPal is only just a payments platform, but they have the advertising business, they have a lot of other products as they're launching this commerce platform. And so, this actually becomes more meaningful. You can see that it bottomed and it's climbing. They're going to post an all-time high uh on active users on the annual basis and also probably on the monthly basis as well. So, uh what else am I looking for? Transaction margins I think will actually be up as well. We see that they continue to go up and margins as well. Net income, that's transaction margin dollars. That's worth keeping an eye on. They guided a little bit more aggressively than normal, though we will see that 5% revenue hit from that Brainree strategy shift at least through the first half, possibly continuing a little bit into the second half. I'm also very curious to see how Fastlane has updated. They were targeting large merchants first and moving down market. Uh so we should see some acceleration there. They might give us some early reads as well on the advertising platform. And of cou",

Those are all important numbers. Now, later next week, we do see Robin Hood as the next of these. And Robin Hood, we do have most of their monthly metrics. January and February, we have their full complete metrics. We have a little glimpse of Marches as well. And so with that said, I need to share those. So here these are and monthly as well. You can find these on their investor relations page. I I think that there's not going to be much of a room for a surprise here simply because most of those numbers are priced in. IDKR did have their earnings already. They're a competitor with Robin Hood. They noted that there was a 10 to 12% pullback on margin levels. I expect that we'll see that as the markets begin to deteriorate there in March because of the chaos and tariff uncertainty. So, I'm very curious also to see how their what their annual run rate is on some of their newer products. They've given us early reads on these and I appreciate that. So, Legend, Futures, Events, Contracts, all are likely performing well. I'm wondering which gets to that $100 million annual run rate first. Maybe one of them already did it, although I think we're maybe a quarter or two away from that. I'd like to see gold attach rate continue to climb. Uh maybe they have an early read on strategies, although they won't see too much revenue on that yet, but I'm very curious and also uh just kind of curious on uh that margin. Of course, they don't guide so uh they don't have to worry about the tariffs or the chaos or anything like that. Now, the next company that reported is uh going to be Palanteer. That's May 5th, so a little bit further out. Now, Palanteer has typically uh beat and done a triple beat, and I think that that will be the case here. What's going to be interesting with Palunteer is they actually have prett",

I'm curious if Palanteer does the same and if they do uh that's going to get a lot of attention. I know the stock's elevated. I'm not a buyer here but I think the market will be very interested that they're that confident in their future earnings despite the chaos uh of the current macro situation. And that's going to shine if so that's going to stand out like a very bright light shining in darkness among all this other uncertainty that we're having. So be paying attention to see if that will happen. Now HIMS is also reporting as well. Uh HIMS is reporting at the same time as Palunteer on May 5th after hours. Uh so how will they do? I think that they'll have no problems with this earnings. Uh quarter two is where it's actually is going to get pretty interesting. um they they always uh beat on revenue. They always except for one small occasion beat on EPS. Uh so I expect that will continue to be the case. Their guidance though was very aggressive uh when they came in with quarter 4. And so this is what they were projecting and uh they are factoring in a lot right here especially from weight loss revenue. GLP1s were perhaps taken away a little bit earlier than they expected but they had that in time for this guidance. And so that made me scratch my head a little bit. So I'm very curious if their oral solution is just poised to accelerate a whole lot more or if there's some things that I'm missing. Um so as far as guidance, keep an eye on that.

And so this massive headwind that they experienced in dollar neutral terms, New Bank, I don't think it'll be there. Brazil seems a little bit more stable. There's some macro macroeconomic concern there. I expect Mexico and Colombia are also doing well. So, I think that they'll be fine. And actually, I was wrong. We have a bonus stock, my newest holding, which is Nvidia. Now, Nvidia did uh note that for upcoming investors, and they report, by the way, on May 28th, probably, we don't know the date for sure, but it's very late compared to most uh they record a 5.5 billion hit. Um, this will be in quarter 1, 2026, which yes, is the quarter that they're reporting on. They name it a little bit differently because they're forward-looking. I I don't know why they do it, but they do it that way. So, uh, regardless, I think a lot of this is priced into the stock and it maybe price into the analyst expectations, although perhaps a few did not revise, but nevertheless, Nvidia was expecting a lot of acceleration uh, partly because of Blackwell scaling and some other products as well not being in short supply. And so I think that we won't see that acceleration the way that we would if this H20 hit wasn't happening. But uh nevertheless outside of the this hit u you'll see some acceleration. I think that'll surprise the market. So they will probably beat based on analyst expectation the revenue uh they'll likely beat on EPS and for guidance I think that they might just watch and see what Apple does. Apple is kind of uniquely among the Mac 7 hit by tariffs. And so if Apple says, \"Hey, we're not going to guide this time, we're going to pull back our guidance just because of this uncertainty.\" I think Nvidia says, \"You know what?

          "content": "Hey guys, it's Crossroads here. Today we're going to talk about Palunteer and this war that they've declared with the New York Times and frankly vice versa. Now, if you're not familiar with it, let's take a look and we'll talk about at the end of this video. Stock implications. This is again my biggest position. It's a little bit under half of my portfolio and uh it's one of my favorite companies out there. So, I am biased. Uh I've done a lot of research in Palunteer, hundreds and hundreds of hours. Uh, and so let's take a look. New York Times published this article. Trump taps Palunteer to compile data on Americans. And this is a gift article. I I think you can access it for the next, you know, week or two uh for free. Uh, it's it's an interesting read and there's a lot of misconceptions about Palunteer. I think that they may have dodged in the some of the wording that they used coming flat out with lies, but there's a lot in there basically insinuating that Palanteer is or could be used to spy on Americans and compile their data so big bad Trump will do horrible things. I'm not sure what that is. U and the reality is they have a fundamental misunderstanding of what Paler does. Basically, think of it like an operating system but for a business. But uh think about like when you install Windows on your computer, you have a hard drive, you have your own data on there. You install an operating system and the operating system is a piece of software that helps you interface with your own data and do things with it. And that's what Palunteer really is. It operationalizes data. It does not collect data. It doesn't store data or anything like that. They don't have any uh thing of any kind like that in their architecture. Um but uh that's that's what they are. And people don't really understand like that this is, you know, it's a software technology. It's it's not a big scary company that's out there. I know they have a scary sounding name. Uh they do have some government co",

          "content": "\"Uh, Palanteer is collecting data on Americans.\" It's like, okay, that's a good way to get sued. So, don't say that, guys. uh you you can think what you'd like uh but it's just it's not factual. So um another thing that Palanteer put out too, they they created this organization a little while ago because there are ways that tech uh technology from Palunteer can be abused. Just like if you install your uh Windows operating system on your computer and then you hack into the Social Security Administration, should Microsoft be blamed? Well, probably not. Uh but nevertheless, it can be used in a nefarious way just like Palunteer technology. They do what they can on a granular level as far as permission to prevent that. They've even chosen to not um uh to pull back on a contract where there were some severe concerns with an international contract. uh but beyond that uh largely you know they're they of course have been tasked for a lot of good stuff on the commercial side and also a lot of good on the governmental side and then some controversial stuff with Maven specifically with ICE and of course uh with Ukraine and Israel as well. So, uh, you know, it's it's not a company that everybody is comfortable investing in because there is a defense contractor side of things because they provide that software infrastructure on the background. And so, um, I understand people saying and and saying that they're squeamish or they're uncomfortable with Palunteer for that reason. That makes sense to me. Yeah, personally, I don't I don't think that way. But saying that it is a data company that stills or compiles or has your data is just wrong. This goes into a little bit on the technical side itself. So if you're curious, you can actually go into that. U but let's look a little bit further. So Palunteer didn't just stop there. If you look actually on X, uh Trump and Musk divorce is getting a lot of the focus instead of the Palunteer article. Uh I think it might have been a little bit ",

This is not just take Palunteer's word for it. So, it is a bit ironic that Palunteer would point out and say, \"Okay, you guys are accusing us of potentially stealing Americans data,\" which I mean, that's their software. That's not what they do. Uh, and uh instead, it's actually you guys that are stealing and monetizing American data. So very fun twist right there. Uh on a more technical side, if you're interested, Chad Waldquist works for Palunteer. He is he does a great job with communication, breaking down technical concepts as well, and he really goes into the both on the Palunteer side, but also here on the New York Times talking about just basically their um being one of the worst offenders in the internet of stealing your data and selling it to others as well. So it's again quite ironic. This is Palunteer very much on the war path. Now New York Times, they were not taking it lying down. And so they issued not only a a comment where they said no are our we're actually factual in everything that we do and we're absolutely right. They launched two other hit pieces on Palunteer. And so this one is on the compensation of Alex Karp which is very rich. uh you know this is a company that he's been at for almost 20 years and uh stockbased compensation is a big part of Palunteer so he's one of the richest men in the world because of his time at Palunteer because it's done so well as a stock but it says the rich compensation for being the CEO and it goes into that detail and then the other article was Palanteer's collection of disease data at CDC stirs privac",

One thing that's true though is that you have increased your contracts with the government. And the contracts Sarah Eisen goes into uh have increased with Palunteer. their government revenue is growing rapidly and usually that's when Palunteer gets the biggest push back. It's not other times when they're not getting massive contracts. It's almost like that there's people out there that have companies that would love to have some of these contracts and they decided to try to hit things below the belt. We saw that with NHS when Palanteer was going after the federated database and they ended up uh because of political pressure being forced to share that contract with a lot of other providers which I I don't fully understand the the technical side of that. So maybe it's a good thing. I'm skeptical on that. Usually when politics is involved in making decisions with technology that's not the best decision maker at all. Um but uh regardless uh this has been an interesting riff and I don't think that it's over yet. Uh what I think that we might see is actually another few articles from the New York Times. Uh there could be some funding as well, you know, as far as other people coming out with Nasty Graham things on Palunteer, which happens from time to time when you're a big company. Inevitably that'll happen, especially when you're on the data side, especially when you've made an outspoken uh argument for Western values in the United States as well. But a word of caution to the New York Times is well this obviously is not a like CIA backed or MSAD backed that that's utterly ridiculous. Um they're not spilling data but one thing that Paler does very well is stand up for themselves.

Although I don't know that it'll be long lasting. This is not a highly shorted stock simply because I mean people know what what the what the the the company is uh doing on a high level, the government contracts that they're obtaining as well. Uh, but beyond that, I also think that it'll get some people to look into Palunteer for the first time and realize like, hey, maybe all that that I've heard about them being big and scary is actually false. I quite like what they're doing. I could go back to 2020 when I first heard about Palunteer and I was like, oh man, I don't know about that. Actually looked into them and I was like, okay, they're actually founded on, yes, using and operationalizing data, but also protecting civil liberties. And I love that. And the more I looked into the company, I was like, I need to get a part of this. And so I entered the company as far as a shareholder in 2021 and January. So anyway, uh as far as a stock, I don't think it's going to change too much. It may cause some scrutiny uh with uh the way that contracts are procured. There might be a couple of companies that actually end up not signing on with Palanteer just because they don't want that public scrutiny. But I think that times really have changed. I",

Now, you may have missed this headline, but it's all on tariffs, but looking at Google, looking at PayPal, typically these stocks tend to be a little bit less volatile than a lot of the peers in the US market. Both were down about 5% today. Uh, which is unusual. uh even though it was quite the draw down actually if you look at the NASDAQ over the last day and a half or so we had about a 5% downturn uh which is half a correction that doesn't happen every week uh and there's a reason why specifically Google and PayPal really did get hit hard today. Let's take a look first at the stocks here. So here is PayPal. You can see it's down 5.39%. Goo Google of course has Google or Google but either way you look at it it's down 4.88% 88% very unusual and it's really coming from one place. This is a Reuters article uh entitled Berlin on measures against US tech giants. Nothing is off the table and specifically there's a lot of talk about tariffs but earlier in the morning there is a lawmaker from the EU that specifically called out these two. So specifically here he had said in the case of digital service providers there's also a huge economic interest on the part of US companies in this respect you can also look at charging fees on PayPal or Google what exactly does that mean this we're not really sure what it means that's a tough thing basically the market looked at this and said you know what let's shoot and ask questions later",

Did not see Google and did not see PayPal as much of a risk as far as it comes to tariffs. You think of those typically on physical products. You can also think of them, you know, as far as like software as a service type of stuff. But in both respects, it seemed like Google and especially PayPal were pretty safe. PayPal, after all, is mostly about peer-to-peer uh payments uh payment service processing and that sort of thing as well. So, for them to be called out specifically, that's kind of interesting. And the wording of this specifically is charging fees on Google and on PayPal. I'm not sure how that will work. PayPal is in the EU quite a bit, especially in Germany. And uh it is used very heavily there by the consumers. And I'm not sure if this means that on top of any service fee that PayPal charges that there's going to be an additional service fee just because they're PayPal. If so, that is a really unfair and b it's going to be really rough for PayPal as a company. Uh just because people don't like paying fees and if you It just depends on what this is, but if you double the fees uh just because it's some silly tax, that's tough. Uh could it be a fee leveled at the actual companies uh for Google and PayPal where they're like, \"Okay, because we don't like what your government's doing with tariffs, we're going to hit you with a 1 billion fee.\" They could do that. um uh just like for the price of doing business. Now the odds of this happening are very very low. I I think for a few reasons. For one, I think that there will be some measure of negotiation hopeful by that April 2nd deadline so that hopefully President Trump, the United States can",

          "content": "April 2nd deadline so that hopefully President Trump, the United States can come to terms with the EU, with Canada, with Mexico, and so forth. Um, but even beyond that, it seems like retaliatory tariffs would be something like, okay, if you're charging 25% on uh vehicles, we're going to do the same for vehicles from the United States and that sort of uh thing, rather than specifically hitting Google and PayPal uh directly. Now, what made this even more funny is if you look at other companies that are similar to Google and that are similar also to PayPal, you can see that they weren't hit nearly as much. So case in point is Visa. Visa is not in Europe as much. They they are making excellent headroads. Uh one of those was of course Visa. Visa is not in the EU quite as much. They're making excellent inroads on a couple of products, but they're a small player compared to PayPal. Visa wasn't mentioned. They easily could have been mentioned. They're actually much more of a US firm than uh PayPal. And yet they are down only 2%. Mastercard is another one. Mastercard is also making inroads in their EU, but they're still a relatively small player. They're down 3% versus where PayPal and Google went. Now, what about a Google competitor? Even though Microsoft and Google do not do the same thing, Microsoft does have being Microsoft does have, of course, the data centers. And you can see here today, Microsoft is down a lot less than Google as well. So this did seem like it was very headline specific with that call out of PayPal, with that call out of Google. The market is not efficient. The market is not always rational and it just looked at PayPal and Google and said, \"Oh, these tariffs uh retaliatory measures are going to specifically hit PayPal and Google. Let's sell these off",

Let's sell these off as hard as we can.\" Now, of course, everything was pretty red today, uh, for the most part, so it shouldn't be a surprise that these fell, but I would have expected maybe 2% today, possibly 3% in both of these names. Both are actually looking relatively cheap. I'm not super bullish on Google, but it is attractive as far as valuation and what they're building as well. PayPal, I've talked about this quite a bit. It feels like the worst case downside, honestly, is opportunity cost. You look at the multiples, they're increasingly cheap. You look at the buybacks, if PayPal, and hopefully this is not the case, but if PayPal sits here for three years, uh they're going to end up buying back a third of the stock in three years as they improve free cash flow, as they improve revenue, as they improve margins, as they improve transaction margin dollars. And that's without baking anything in from the new innovation. And that's without banking on anything from the new innovations that they're cooking up which really should start hitting in the second part of this year as far as some revenue and then next year certainly as well. So it just kind of one of those things where sometimes a market is irrational. Now keep in mind there's a often quoted saying that says that the market can be irrational longer than you can be solvent. So I don't suggest taking any uh crazy risks here. I mean you do you. It's your money. It's they call it personal investing for that reason. But I wouldn't uh bet the farm necessarily on either of these because we could still see a lot of pain and a lot further downside despite this being a silly silly sell-off.

Google, if it was the only thing that had fallen out of everything in the market, I'd probably have a Google position, even though I'm fairly neutral on that. I'm bullish on some parts and bearish on others. Um, but it's an interesting time as we have more and more uncertainty in the markets. Markets don't love uncertainty. And really until this gets resolved and it may not be fully resolved by April 2nd, there could still be a lot of pain even though we've seen a lot of pain. Let me show you one last thing too in the broader market. This is the NASDAQ. Uh, of course, the NASDAQ is a bit more volatile than S&P 500. But we can see here uh as far as the draw down, if we go to the peak, which is right here, we are at a 13% correction. Now, in terms of the market, 13% is officially a correction. It's actually at 10%. Uh once we actually see 20%, if that actually happens, technically speaking, we're no longer in a bull market for the NASDAQ. And I don't know that we'll get that far. Even just recently, you can see uh 5% downturn. That's half a correction from the 25th through the 28th. That doesn't happen too many times unless there's major major news.

You know, they do. Uh, it might be another dollar or dollar less or something. I don't know. uh if I ordered one today from from Buds or elsewhere. And then the Kimber I think runs around 8 850 actually this model of the uh the K6S. And so uh one thing that that comes up constantly uh you know amongst you all and everybody that is involved with firearms and particularly people that maybe haven't been in firearms as long is what is the difference? You know, why do people pay so much for some firearms, you know, and is that cheaper firearm? Excuse me, less expensive firearm. Please forgive me for my uh the connotations of the words I might use. Cheap has negative connotations, doesn't it? But anyway, more inexpensive and, you know, versus expensive. So, you know, do they work? Uh what what's the difference? And and to be honest, disclaimer, you know, some things I'm not so sure about. You know, we could argue about MIM parts, you know, and steel strength and the steel that is used in uh Italy on some of those firearms, the uh you know, the the clones of Colt clones and the cowboy guns and all that. You know, people criticize the quality of steel sometimes it's used. Others say, \"No, it's just as good as our steel.\" And then in the Philippines where the RI, you know, so some of that, you know, I'm not sure the verdict is not totally in. Uh a lot of people have uh information or opinions on it. So, just do your research and I'll kind of let you know what I know, what I think. So, we're just goi",

So, how impressive your firearm is to to your fellow shooters and friends, that's the most important thing, right? Just joshing you, but yeah, well, you know, pride of ownership and all that falls under that. So, just kidding a little bit. But let's do start with some of the superficial things. Uh, well, it's important though. Fit and finish. All right, fit and finish. Uh, obviously you get a difference if you're paying more money. This is stainless, and I think stainless is a little harder to work with. Uh, not dramatically. A lot of inexpensive guns are made of stainless, of course, but this is really finished uh kind of a brush uh finish. And as part of the finish, I'll include the melting effect. You know, it's just no sharp edges. Look at that. So, uh, you know, when more money is involved, you're able to do that. The contours, uh, just really nice. On this one, they're able to, of course, kind of an innovative design on this Kimber. They they cut down the cylinders, so it would take up less or would have less width. So, it's kind of interesting thing. And in this particular revolver, they it holds six shots, so it's not much bigger than a Jframe, Smith, and Wesson. So, that took some engineering and, you know, the grinding and the honing down to get all those soft edges. It's totally snag free except for the hammer on this one. I meant to have my other one out here. Uh, it doesn't have the hammer, but you know, you get a basically snag-free firearm. Okay, so that's part of the fit and finish. This one, you got what? Parkerized finish. Okay, not a lot of polishing involved in that. Not a lot of deep blueing like you might find on a Python or something or a Smith and Wesson. And so, you know, your finish is going to be a difference. Uh fit, you know, I don't see any major problems with the fit on on this one. If you look at the crane up here, how it fits together is not some gigantic gap ",

          "content": "finished firearm. That's what you get when you put more money into the firearm as far as fit and finish. You usually get better grips, too. You know, we got some uh I forget what that is, rosewood or walnut, but you know, nice wooden grips, nicely finished with checkering and everything. Even got the Kimber logo on it. Uh so you get more expensive grips and grips like that. I've bought a lot of aftermarket grips at gun shows or ordered them, Eagle Grips or whoever. Uh that alone uh those can be like half the cost of this Rock Island Armory pistol. They really can. It's easy for them to be $75 for a set of that. So So you're more likely to get something other than rubber grips. All right. Uh and the and the grip fit, too. Now, this could be a $400 gun. This could be a $700 gun. Lots of uh comparisons in between. And uh and the the grip fit could be even different. And we'll talk a little more about that. One thing I don't want to forget too is that we appreciate the help of Atmix. Look at that big 10 bar of silver. Is that cool or what? So, we appreciate the help from them. Check out uh the description. You'll see links to atmix.com as well as our favorites page, you know, on our in our description. Some of John's and my favorite, you know, atmix things maybe we've ordered just we like. So, appreciate their help. Uh so, there with anything I say, there's different levels. So everything is not 200 or 800 cuz those are kind of the extremes. But you could even have wooden grips, you know, on a on a low-end revolver, but maybe the wood's not as nice. It's just some nondescript wood. There's no checking maybe. And maybe the fit is to the metal is not even as that good uh you know as the Kimber. So obviously there there's gray areas. Okay. And another difference of course the actual name brand. You know, that's that's kind of a factor in terms of resale. Uh yeah, there we go. Pride of ownership.

          "content": "one difference. uh quite often, you know, with like Smith and Wesson, Colt, different different revolvers. Uh they're made in this country and that may be one reason they're more expensive, right? But that is a difference. That's one reason that this firearm costs less. Okay? So, that's just a fact. Uh warranty, you know, you sometimes get a much excuse me, better warranty with a more expensive firearm, but not necessarily. Uh the reverse of that can be true. For example, this $200 firearm actually I think now correct me if I'm wrong has a better warranty than Kimber probably is this I think has a lifetime warranty. Uh again I think based on whoever owns it. It's not just the original purchaser I believe. So you know there you go. I think the Kimber is the original purchaser and for like a year or two or something. Okay. Parts and labor whatever for the first year or second year. I'm not sure. So, uh, I think this firearm actually has a better overall warranty. Now, it might also be more likely to break or wear out. Who knows? But, and that is true for any kind of warranty. It's easier to give a warranty, a really good warranty on something that was really cheap to make. If you think about it, you can you can afford to replace it much easier, right? Okay. So, so that is not necessarily a factor of a more expensive gun. It could be either one. Just depends. customer service ties into that and that's doesn't seem to be necessarily tied to how much you pay for the firearm. Uh some of you have input on that. I'm sure many of you have a lot of input on the things we're talking about here and feel free to share your opinions on all of this and make it a kind of an education for people because quite often uh you know the warranties and all that kind of thing and uh the customer service the one company like Colton Smith and Wesson are companies you you consider being about the same uh they might have a vast difference in their customer service. you'll see people really comp",

          "content": "is uh, very nice. feels almost like a Smith and uh the Smith usually has a good single action and so does this one. Not much difference at all on the single action trigger pull. Double action you can feel the smoothness. Okay, so less hand work on a firearm like this or maybe no hand work. And that's one point to make about the difference when uh we're talking about I would guess I could be wrong but like 50 years ago 60 70 years ago of firearms that were this this different in price range there might have been more difference mechanically than there is today. Why? Well, with CNC machinery now, you know, computer assisted uh, you know, m manufacturing and everything, there's really no reason why you can't make even a pretty inexpensive firearm, uh, pretty consistently, you know, and the parts match up and it' be pretty consistent. So, that's that's that's a plus for a cheap gun really. Just like Rock Island Army or anybody's cheap 1911s, the parts are what they are and we're able to to create and machine things in a in a precise way. All right. And uh so trigger, you know, uh this one has a little bit better trigger, but the other one's not horrible. This cheap gun does not have that bad a trigger. The mechanics, uh let me show you the mechanics. Let me put some more ammo in. I think in terms of the mechanics and the operation of them, again, there's not a lot of difference. And that's a a compliment to this Rock Island Armory. It's a compliment because I was expecting this firearm to just be really cheap. and and not operate well. But we've had no issues with it. I'm going to shoot double action. Boom. [Applause] You know, it it's just mechanically very sound. Okay. And it's not quite as smooth, but it's very sound mechanically. And uh that's very important how they operate. Uh the reliability. I just put four in there. Let's see. The Kimber goes No. Yeah, it's like a Smith. Now, this one going double action is a little smoother, but uh you know, nothing to write h",

Well, this thing has worked great. Uh but who knows? As far as longevity, it could be that if we we set out to fire 5,000 rounds, that'd take a while, wouldn't it? Through a six shot revolver, that maybe the Rockon Armory would just make it to 3,000. I don't know. Or if we have both these and you shoot them and carry them for the next 10 years, maybe the Rock Island Armory would warp out on you and it just wouldn't be as mechanically sound. Some of the maybe the MIM parts would be breaking. You'd have to replace after 3, four, five years. I don't know that. If you have opinions on that, uh, especially if they're based on any knowledge or fact, you know, share. be glad to to hear because that that old business of MIM parts gets knocked around a lot and it's probably overrated. And it coast on that same topic. Are you carrying this firearm for self-defense? Is it a self-defense pistol or is it just a range gun? If it's just a range gun, then MIN parts, steel that only lasts 10 years, none of that's quite as important, is it? For 200 bucks, buy another one, you know, in seven years. All right. But now, if it's a carry gun, you don't want it to fail at the wrong time. And that makes it maybe more worthwhile to, you know, invest a little more money in it, okay, if you wary about that. All right. So, anyway, reliability, longevity, yeah, kind of hard to to determine that for sure, isn't it? But some of you may have experience with it. You may have bought a this M200's been out for several years in various configurations. You might have had a farm like this or this one out, you know, for the last 10 years. and you've actually done some of that testing, you've fired it enough times, you have a valid opinion about that or some, you know, actual experience accuracy.

Maybe if it's a range gun, not that important. If you if you kind of like the pistol, I'm talking about myself. If I just wanted a a revolver to shoot on the range, money's tight. I'd have no problem with this $200 pistol. I'm not going to be defending my life with it. If it breaks, something breaks, I'll see what it would cost to fix it or or just buy another one for $200. Wow. I mean, you cost half that to fill up your truck, you know, gasoline almost. So, so it's not a big deal. But if it's a firearm you're relying on uh to protect your life, then you know we I think all of us have a tendency to want to go ahead and put whatever extra money in that we can afford and that we feel is necessary and get right down to it. Right. So and and again the these other pistols over here revolvers are they're kind of 78 $900 range pay on the firearm. Just just nicer nicer handguns in some ways. A better feel, a better name. uh easier maybe to resell uh possibly would last longer and you know I won't rehash all that but but we just want to give you an idea what are you getting when you see that kind of difference in price and those are some of the differences you know just maybe the reliability the fit and finish uh you know those sorts of things. This one, another difference is it'll fire 357 Magnum and it's a small gun. So, you know, the metallurgy and everything uh is uh really good on that. Okay, that could be part of the reason this is not chambered and I don't think they even make it in uh in 357 Magnum. So, it could be a issue we talked about. They do allow plus P in these, but they don't recommend a steady diet of plus P in this 38 special as big as it is. So, you know, again, something to think about. All righ",

I'm shielding you from bad decisions and whatever else might be after you because I have another shield. the performance center version of the Shield Plus. Okay. And uh on I see a cowboy hiding back there. See if I can pick him off from behind that plate. Got him. Got him. Got him. That's the important thing. I didn't want to hit the hostage. That little plate was a hostage. So that's the practical shooting. That's what's important more so than whether you hit the bullseye with a pistol like this, right? I mean, it is, but you want to be able to hit what you're aiming at. I mean, ideally, that would work out best for you in most situations. So, yeah, this is the uh the Performance Center Shield Plus. And uh I guess this is almost like a chapter 2, just a chance to shoot the new Shield again. Okay. But, uh, there's a couple of differences between the standard model and this one, and I'll point those out in about 5 seconds, right? But, you know, the Shield, the new Shield, uh, I'll link to the first video, of course, and most of you are familiar with the the Shield Plus and the upgrade in terms of capacity. Uh, and uh, you know, I won't go through all that again, but the capacity, the the grips a little better, and uh, it's uh, just just a nice pistol. The trigger has been improved somewhat, those kinds of things. And while I'm loading, I'll uh, I'll a couple things on this. You can see on the most of them are on the top. You got porting on the performance center. Okay. Like the uh, the earlier shields on the the performance center models, you had porting. You got the fiber optic uh front sight and you have a really nice sight system. If you look at that, you use a fiber optic front and rear just jump out at you. They really do.

Depending on where you buy them, it has to become more plentiful, more available, uh, after the pandemic is totally over, which it pretty much is as we do this. And, uh, you know, we'll see. The shield has been famous for being priced very reasonably being a lot of gun for the money and I would expect these to fall down into that category as well. So yeah, the performance model and I've talked about that with the earlier models whether the porting was all that great. Uh I I maybe can tell just a tad bit of difference, but I don't feel like if you're a new shooter like, oh yeah, I don't like recoil. I'm going to have to save up another whatever 75 bucks. I'll have to have this version of the shield or I won't be able to hit with it. Don't don't uh labor under that misconception. Yeah, they might make a little difference but not uh not dramatic. Okay, I mean not not you might not even notice it. Okay. Or you might I don't kind of depends again like a lot of things with little handguns especially or any handgun your level of experience.

If uh [sighs] you and I go out to shoot basketball and you've never even shot a basketball and I had a really nice expensive leather basketball and then a the cheapest one I could find, you probably wouldn't be able to shoot any better with either one of them, would you? Maybe I wouldn't, but I [laughter] shot a lot of basketball and I would be able to tell the difference in that really nice leather NBA ball or college ball, whatever. Uh, Spalding, I would. Yeah, this is what I want, you know. But you wouldn't really maybe notice the difference until you got more experience. Guess what? It's the same with handguns, I think. All right, let's try the This gives me a chance to shoot th",

Let's try that red L uh two later. See if I'm pulling left or not. I'm on a bowling pin. You know, bowling pins are not uh they're not microscopic that I need to tell you that. But they're easy to miss. Uh those of you who have shot bowling pins, uh they're really nice targets. They're tough and they're big enough, but they are easy to miss because if you think about that thing, uh you know, you're you are shooting at something about that wide. Okay? Even though they're big old heavy things, don't want to drop them on your toe, right? And then if you're shoot a little bit high, uh I'm a physics expert, right? If you're just a little high, then look what you're shooting at. You know, something about that narrow. So, uh they're a little tricky, but whenever you can pop bowling pins, uh your sights must be okay or you're you're not having too bad a day cuz they can be frustrating if you're trying to hit them in a hurry. So, yeah. So, you got your porting. Uh makes a little louder, get a little more blast. Uh I I can do without porting on basically any any handgun really, whether it's a defensive handgun or not, even rifle for the most part. But uh pretty neat. Uh so you have to decide if you've not bought your new shield yet and you're thinking about one whether those new features are worth it. And they might be cuz it's not all that much more and you still get all, you know, that nice flat trigger and all the stuff you get with the basic Shield Plus. But, uh, you might want to have the capability going forward of being able to, you know, install an optic on it. You might just really be sorry that you didn't get one that had that. And again, this one doesn't have it, but it's available with that. And, uh, you know, and you can decide on some things. I don't know how widely available they are. Uh, when you're w",

I don't have a suppressor to put on this or a barrel that would take one, but we've really had fun with the uh suppressors from Silencer Central and uh appreciate, you know, their help and big help. You they'll take care of all the paperwork for you pretty much and uh ship that thing to you when it is approved. So, it's good to have someone knows a lot about suppressors to help you out. So, and they're really, really good people. So, I'm going to shoot one more mag. And uh it's a great time for handguns, isn't it? The shield is just one of the one of the best. It's not for everybody, but it is one of the best. I'm going to cheat and load buck mags. And uh gosh, we got the P365 now. Got the Hellcat. We've got the Sig uh P365 XL and just lots of firearms. The Glock 43, 43X. There's a firearm really in any size and uh well, not trigger configuration, but with a trigger that you probably would like. You just have to experiment with them. And really, all those firearms I've mentioned, they ought to be showing up in uh in gun shops where they have nice shooting ranges to where they are available to actually go in, rent them, and try them out. So, let me shoot one more time and see what I think about this thing. All right. Pretty nice. It's a target-rich environment, isn't it? Just felt like I wanted to shoot all of those round plates. Okay. I guess round's pretty common for a plate. Not many square ones. Let's just do it again. That was fun. Uhoh. Like I said, pulling pins are tricky. Had enough. They're spread around for everybody, even the cowboy. So, the performance center shield, uh, I don't know. Maybe I've just been shooting the shield enough now. It feels better. I I feel like I'm ready to go to war with this one. I I feel like I've got a better handle on it. I don't know what that's about. Probably those little ports make the difference, right?

Okay, it's obviously not original. It's made in modern times and no one has an original. They go out and shoot like this cuz the original Henry's actually shoot a rimfire 44. Where are you going to find that ammo? Right. Uh so they're all very very old and nobody fires those things. Maybe somebody does, but you can't get ammo for those. So, but this is what they named this uh proper name. Original Henry, you know, rifle is what they call. So, that's why we put in the title. If a lot of people were shooting the old Henry's, the actual real ones uh from 1860 and stuff and doing videos with them, we wouldn't call this original, but we will because though they're not. Okay, so big game hunt. Got the 4570 out the sharps and case. You know, we get a buffalo or ram sometimes. It's a little contrary. All right. So, if so, we pull out some Federal Premium 4570. We put it in the Shallow Sharps and we take care of business if we have to. Okay. So, anyway, 440. So, got some of that just lead bullets and that's our big game hunt. Uh, not an extremely powerful firearm, you know, the 4440, but you know, take game and we're going to just do two. All right. So, you know the drill. Now, I've got it loaded in the interest of time. Yeah, you'll see me load it again, of course. And uh it's not hot, but I'm going to start with the gong and then take out the animals. We have some new people maybe watching. That's the drill. Go back and look at all the big game hunts. We start with the gong, we take out the animals, and go back and finish on the gong. That's all we shoot. It's a big game hunt. We've got sheep. We've got bison, buffalo, uh, turkeys, pigs. So, we have a variety of animals over there. The light's kind of weird on them right now, so that's good. I can use that for an excuse. All right.

Here's how you load them. You all seen the drill, I hope. Pretty neat rifle. Interesting. And uh again, this is uh made by the modern company. No relation to the early Winchester, you know, outfit that made the first Henry's, Benjamin Tyler, Henry and all that. But this is a replica of it. And it is really apparently and seem well when I say apparent it just seems to be very well made. Very well made. It's a beautiful gun. It is just gorgeous. Just gorgeous. Solid. I have enjoyed shooting it for years. Uh 4440. Nothing I've ever really handloaded. So I have to, you know, buy ammo for it. But uh it's it's just a I mean it's gorgeous. Look at that.

Wow. Okay. Wow. Surprise. Okay. Okay. Mr. Bison. Boom. Kiling. Ah. Got that sheep. There's another turkey. Oh boy. You barely see those guys. All right. And there's Okay, I think I make it out. All right. And one for the gong. Got everybody. Yeah. All right, that was the last round. Can you believe I missed that pig? Oh, man. I don't think we've ever had a perfect run. Uh, that guy came close with something else. And there was no excuse for that. I just thought, well, he's a little further up here. I don't want to shoot low, so I held up on top of his back and wouldn't you know it, shot over him twice. So, and uh when I hit him, I was holding on the bottom of him. Figure. Go figure. So anyway, all right. Lots of game for dinner, a variety of game. So, uh, y'all come pick it up and cook it. It'll take, uh, maybe a crockpot cuz it's all really tough, really hard. It really is. Needs a lot of flavoring, too. But anyway, big game hunting with the Henry rifle. It might not have been the very best choice. uh if you were living in 1860 or 1870, 1880 whenever there was still ammo for these because they were not necessarily a powerhouse, but boy, they held some they held some bullets, held some ammo, and uh they were gorgeous rifles. Gorgeous rifles. The 1866 was the Winchester was the improvement of it. And then the 1873 was the improvement of both of them because it did not fire a rimfire cartridge. It fired the center fire 4440 and uh was definitely an improvement. But these are neat. There's nothing more gorgeous. I've always thought they were the most beautiful rifle.

And even chapter 2, so if you'd rather not see me shoot this thing or talk about it a little bit again, you know, it it's not required viewing, but we're glad you're here. Uh anyway, now I think I told you probably in the first video I was going to paint that site white. I never did do it. I forgot it. But when I was out here shooting it a little bit, I realized, oh, I think I was going to paint that white. It's hard to see, especially as the light goes down. So, I don't know if I can hit the 2 L, you know, uh or anything. Well, actually, I know I could if I really wanted to, you know. Let's just make sure we hit them. How's that? There we go. By gosh, that took care of them. And here's for you, buddy. Quick, make sure it's empty. Okay. Ah, that felt good. No foolishness. Yes. Uh the site is a little gray for this time of day, but that's okay. We're going to have some fun with it. I I really do like this gun. It's uh 22 puny little 22.

I told you in the first video how this was kind of a I didn't really retire from teaching. I just had to give it up a little early.

That's right. I forgot it shoots a little bit. Yeah, you hold 6:00 with this thing. Yeah. Uh pretty neat. Even though it has a really short barrel, it's not hard to hit something at reasonable distances. And uh if you like the LCR concept, uh these lightweight revolvers and the high-tech design and everything, you would like one of these. I tell you, uh there's just something about it. Some people probably even use them or have one around for self-defense. Uh not necessarily the best choice, but uh again, beats a sharp stick. And with a revolver at least, uh, you do, uh, mitigate some of the problems that you have with 22, you know, rimf fire, they don't always fire and then they clog up a semi-automatic pistol or rifle. Sometimes they're dirty and you get hangups and all that and you're fumbling with that, you know. So, that's part of the reason, one of the reasons, uh, at least with a revolver, it's probably uh, more likely to fire. And if it doesn't, you know what you can do? You don't have to be clearing jams as much. Uh you can just pull the trigger again and move over to the next one and it will probably fire. It would be very unusual if two did not right. A neat little gun. Hey, you can just put them on every plate. And that's double action. I think I'm empty. Yeah. Uh, I was going to shoot a single action, but I decided against that. It's much more fun to shoot double action. Oh, you can shoot a double or a single, can you? Let's try to put one on the gong. And uh I don't know if we'll be able to hear it. That's the only thing. Sometimes I can't hear it with my earplugs in, but when I look at the video later, I can. Okay, so it holds eight rounds. It's just a pretty cool little gun. They have a fantastic grip.

I again, as I've pointed out so many times, I don't try I I have speed loaders for a lot of revolvers, but I rarely use them. It's just fun to to enjoy the simplicity of a revolver. Okay.

Hi, I'm Zeke with the Sonor and Desert Institute and here at SDI, we're extremely proud to be sponsors of the Hickok 45 channel. You may be asking yourself, what is SDI? SDI is an affordable, fully accredited distance learning education program. We have an emphasis in gunsmithing and firearms technology. If you decide to become a gunsmith, you'll need to learn proper gunsmithing techniques. And while some people will use an apprenticeship program to gain these techniques, a formal education will ensure an organized, more comprehensive learning environment. But when you choose a gunsmithing school, it's still kind of difficult. So it's very important that you choose a gunsmithing school that meet the following criteria. First, look for a nationally or regionally accredited program. And whether distance learning online or through a brickandmortar ground program, a gunsmithing program should always have a hands-on element. And finally, make sure you look for a school with high student satisfaction. Find reviews online, check out its Facebook or other social media, or get on the same social media sites, find some alumni and ask to speak with them about their experience. And while we're not at SDI today, I do have some of the firearms I've learned to work on and build myself through the SDI program. So, let's go take a look at them. Okay, maybe not. We'll just get seriously. Can I not get a chair that fits me? I'm a big guy, dude. So, I guess back to wh",

But, you know, it occurred to me. We have never really just ordered a new 44 Magnum and shot it, put it through its paces, showed it to you. There seems like most of the 44s, the Smith and Wessons are classic uh firearms in some way that I have. Like that one there that was made in whatever 7980 I don't know long in there pin barrel and all that. This is one that's just available to anybody today. They're still making them. Hard to believe. Uh they're still very very popular. They've just never gone out of favor. Uh they really there's a lot more powerful firearms out there. Handguns like we really need it, right? And uh but you know the old classic 29 or 629, you know, there it is. You got the key lock. Yeah, you got that. You don't have pin barrel. You don't have recess cylinders and the different cylinder latch and some things like that, but it's still a model 629, which is stainless for the 29, right? And it still shoots those big 44 mag rounds. So, I thought I'd just order one from Buds and uh and shoot the thing and uh you know, you probably see it there. But uh we'll send it back to them. So, anyway, I've got some of my loads in there. I only start out with those. They're not quite as uh threatening to me as factory ammo. Uh but you know, in this handle in the 6-in barrel with this grip, this grip doesn't absorb all the shock. Let me put it that way.

How about a pot smoking adventure boy? 44 smokes it. I love that when it creates the smoke. Reminds me of Monument Valley. All that red dust. Pretty cool. Oh, look at that little can.

I just put those in the speed loader. Keep them separate. And to remind you that those exist, as I've told you many times, I don't really work on loading one fast. It's a little bit like learning to load a flint lock to for rapid fire or something like why bother unless you're competing or something. Oh, let's put a couple on this target here. That'll tell me where the sights are, maybe even though it's pretty close. I think it's going somewhere there near the trending left. I believe that was it. Click. Yeah. Okay. Ah, that's a nice load that I load, if I do say so myself. It's a It's a very comfy load. It's a It's a Magnum, but it's a low-end magnum, unlike these. So, let's torture me a little bit with these. And these are Federal 240 grain rounds. And as you know from earlier videos, they're fairly stiff. So, while we have these out, why don't we Well, I don't want to smell watermelon yet. Let's try that jug. I think it will go through it. It's a jug of water. It's an old kitty litter jug. So, the truth is revealed. We have cats. Yeah, those hit pretty hard. No doubt about it. Suitable for cinder blocks. Yeah. See what I mean? That's got once we hit the cowboy, it uh will set him back. Knocks him around, doesn't it? Wow. These ought to smoke a pot, too. That is some serious pot smoking right there. Okay, we got one left for you, Mr. Green Melon. So, John, are we going to get melon all over us? All over my leg. Okay, took him out. 44 has plenty of punch. It's really all you need for most applications, I tell you. Oh man, there are some bigger things out there. The the uh 454, the 460, the 500, you know, we've shot all those except for the 460, I guess. And uh the 44 is plenty. 357 is plenty. And uh let's take a Well, let's let's see.

They are comfortable enough to shoot where you could stand here and shoot 50 or 100 of them if you wanted to, or you could shoot 44 special. Let's try a couple of those for for fun. I started to say for kicks, but they don't kick. Yeah, just like a 357, you can enjoy 44 special, 38 special, you know, in the same revolver. Uh, so that makes it very versatile and a nice little clinker. Uh, now I might get a different point of aim in terms of elevation. Let's try these little two liters here. Let's see. I probably go I don't know. Maybe higher or lower. Maybe a lot lower or higher. Let me hold up a little more. Well, I'm not sure where it's going. Get a little closer and see if I can tell the uh I'm not too smart, but I know one thing. It shouldn't affect the windage. Okay. So, I'm not blaming it on that. So, it's either going higher or lower or something. boy. Let me let me try the cowboy. I'm going hold right in the middle of it. Oh, okay. It's going a lot higher than I thought. Now I'm probably empty, though. No, I got one left. Okay, I think it was going a lot higher. So, I'm going to hold on the bottom edge of it. We're all learning together here. Uh, what' it do? It touched it. We're going to try that again. Look, this is an experiment. You're a part of it. So, we'll see what we got here. Keep the 44 special separate. Yeah. So, uh yeah, you are learning a little bit here. If you didn't know it already, you get a different point of impact with a lighter round. And it just depends on how far away you're shooting. Now, you would think I would know, but there are a lot. I mean, I could just tell you right away, okay, it's a lighter bullet. it's going higher or it's going lower. It really depends on uh the distance, barrel length, and some different things. Sometimes a barrel that gets out the barrel, a bullet that gets out ",

[Music] I'm not making excuses for for missing really, believe it or not. Uh I can miss. You know that you see me miss uh even when the sights are right on. But just trying to kind of give you the learning experience that I'm going through, for example, cuz it's a new gun. And I think for me, it shoots just a hair left. So, I would need to remove the rear the rear sight over just a little bit to the just a hair to the right. It'd be right on. Uh those are the kinds of things you learn as you, you know, shoot a firearm you've not shot before. And I have shot it a little bit. I just not very much. But uh it and it and with a handgun if it's going just ever so slightly to the left for example on that target you can see I know most of those all went kind of pattern to the left then that at that distance if you double that distance or triple it then uh you know it can make even more of a D. I don't know where I was hitting the rams when I hit them but at that distance I would say they might have been hitting them on the on the left side. Okay. stuff. You might have learned something, you might not have. Let me put some of these hot ones in there. You know, I can see that rear sight. Yeah. Little movement. All right. The barn burners. I'm not going to shoot that one. I just wanted you to see and remind you of the differences. But these are nice old guns. If you can handle recoil at all, uh it's fun to shoot something say this powerful occasionally. Mess around. Some people live and breathe it. you know, oh, give me a magnum magnum round and I go out and shoot 50 of them and that's not really that much fun to me. Even though I can handle it with the best of them, just not that much fun if it's stinging your hands. I I've got a rifle if I want to blow through a barn.

You as you know, we've fired those before, those Federal 240 grain soft points. So, great gun. Uh I mean, the Rugers are great and probably built a little stronger, you know. You know, I'm not I'm not going to say that this is equal to a Ruger in strength or anything. The Red Hawks are maybe a little stronger. I don't know. Uh, but they're strong enough. If you're going to do nothing but shoot the hottest stuff you can find, maybe you do want a Ruger. But, uh, these these a little sleeker in line, not quite as big and heavy, generally speaking. Uh, if you're just going to shoot moderate loads and really hot loads occasionally, you know, a Smith will do you just fine. U, so anyway, pretty cool guns. You know, they one of the differences they don't put the firing pin on the hammer. A lot of you already know that. They put it on the uh on the hammer on the old ones and it's on the frame now. That's one another one of the differences. Uh you know, just you can just quickly you see one lying on a gun show or something. You can you can tell the difference pretty pretty readily there that uh it's an older one, it's a newer one. So, but they work and they get all dirty and they get smoked up like that, especially with hand loads. But who cares? They clean up like a new one, especially the stainless. Well, let's shooting. Let's Let's shoot some special before we wrap up here. Okay, these are rounds that Oh, there's a 9 mm in there. I think I can fire that. Look at the difference. 9 mm right through the chamber. Right through. That tells you a little bit. Even though 44 is not a 45 or a uh 500, it's it's actually 43 caliber. 44 is not to confuse you new shooters, but it's actually 43. All right.

Little bit of change over the years, but they're uh they're both uh still 44 Magnum. Uh very very popular gun, partly thanks to Harry Callahan, right? Uh but they didn't necessarily have to have Harry Callahan to help out. How can you not like a Smith and Wesson to begin with? And how can you not like a 44 44 special 44 Magnum? Okay, he just gave it a good boost there. Made people aware of it, maybe what they've been missing. So anyway, 629. Pretty cool gun. Life is good. Hi, I'm Zeke with the Sonor and Desert Institute. And here at SDI, we're extremely proud to be sponsors of the Hickok 45 channel. You may be asking yourself, what is SDI? SDI is an affordable, fully accredited distance learning education program. We have an emphasis in gunsmithing and firearms technology. If you decide to become a gunsmith, you'll need to learn proper gunsmithing techniques. And while some people will use an apprenticeship program to gain these techniques, a formal education will ensure an organized, more comprehensive learning environment. But when you choose a gunsmithing school, it's still kind of difficult. So, it's very important that you choose a gunsmithing school that meet the following criteria. First, look for a nationally or regionally accredited program. And whether distance learning online or through a brick-and-mortar ground program, a gunsmithing program should always have a hands-on element. And finally, make sure you look for a school with high student satisfaction. Find reviews online, check out its Facebook or other social media, or get on the same social media sites, find some alumni, and ask to speak with them about their experience. And while we're not at SDI today, I do have some of the firearms I've learned to work on and build myself through the SDI program. So, let's go take a look at him. [Music] Okay, maybe not. We'll just get seriously. Can I not get",

Now, this is a shotgun I thought you might be interested in. It's called the Escort. All right. The Escort. you know, G-rated, but it's the Escort by Hatson and made in Turkey. I really wasn't familiar with it. got to browsing around the Buds website and I found this thing and I thought, \"Wow.\" Uh, I wasn't aware of that pump shotgun and uh it was like 138 bucks or 140 bucks and I thought maybe you'd be interested in knowing there is a shotgun out there uh pump shotgun that's seems to work as I have discovered since we got it. I've been shooting it uh for under a couple hundred bucks. You well under a couple hundred bucks and uh you wherever I see it. So anyway, uh the Hatson Escort Slugger, this particular one is called. It's a barebones shotgun. Many of you probably aware of it. It's been around a while. You I was unaware. You imagine that me being more ignorant than you and you probably already knew about it. So, uh, it's a pump shotgun and it holds, uh, either 3 in or 2 and 3/4 in shells. It holds five plus one. Five for my folks in Kentucky. That's 5 + 1 equals six. Okay. But I probably with threeinch round. I'm not tired any 3in rounds in it. It probably just holds four. Again, I'm smart because I'm from Kentucky. But, uh, yeah. So, it's kind of a five plus one. Most people I would guess are going to be firing at a shotgun like this. two and three/4er shells if you might guess. So, but anyways, let's load up. Shoot it some more. You want to? Pretty cool gun. And we're going to shoot this a little bit. Put some more shells in. I'm shooting a bird shot. That's what I started with. And why don't we just shoot the target? You want to?

Let's shoot something different. I've been dying to shoot some more slugs in it. I have shot slugs. It I sort of say the sights seem right on.

So, we'll see. Now, let's shoot some buck shots for the heck of it. What we got that needs buckshot? I'll tell you some of these buckshot. I'm going to walk out here and uh set this this lid back up. This is a prime target. I found this lid and I I had no way of hanging it. So, guess what I did? The most logical thing. See that big hole? Yeah.

It is a aircraft aluminum receiver as it says. And the way is phrased in the literature, I I think the barrel is ched inside. It seems to be. I I wouldn't bet my life on it, but I think it is. Okay. Uh, you know, more share, but I I think it's a chrome barrel interior of the barrel and uh, you know, you got your front sight there and just kind of a plain gain plane jane uh, shotgun alloy receiver, which is not necessarily negative. I always like to remind folks that, you know, Mossberg, Benelli, they have alloy receivers, right? And of course, you got your polymer. And I should have brought my extender. You can put your sling on here. You got your attachments for that. And it did come with uh this uh in the uh the magazine. Okay. So, it limited it to like two rounds in the magazine cuz most of the game laws you're hunting uh allow for two in the magazine, I think. You know, three total. Again, two plus one, three. So, I took that out. Okay. So, it hold a couple more rounds. And that's just kind of the basics. It's made in Turkey. It's called the Sord. There's a couple three different models of it.

Something you should know about, right? I know about it. You ought to know about it cuz most of you know more than I do. Probably about everything, right? All right. The bar is pretty low. Okay.

All right. I know what thing I'm doing. There we go. One thing that's happening with me that's making it maybe look worse when you fire it's breaking loose a little bit. It's coming back just a little bit and uh was right there. If you notice I was bringing it back out and then coming back and it was working better.

But I've had Winchesterers, I Remington's, a lot of different uh kind of defensive style shotguns like this that that uh they were smoother to load and and feed and everything.

And you know, if you're not buying online and you want to actually hold it and check it out, be u tempted by it, which is what happens to me, right? Speaking of that, I appreciate Alabama Holster for their support of the channel. Best little kidex concealment holsters you can imagine. Purr belt inside the waistband, outside the waistband, pocket. Wonderful. wonderful holsters. We appreciate their support. So, I want to shoot one of these again, but I just wanted to remind you of that that uh firearms like this can be looked at and even fondled, handled, you know, intelligently at shows like that. So, if you have an option uh in your neighborhood or you can get to a place like Las Vegas in January or February or Tulsa, it might be worth the trip. you would really enjoy it if you like these sorts of firearms. Okay, so that's kind of why",

Well, actually have been shooting it some and I kind of like it so far. We'll see how it does today. Good looking gun, isn't it? I mean, it's really a good looking gun with the magpole furniture and everything. and uh seems to be well put together. Maybe we will see if we can break it. Now, we're not going to do a torture test or anything, but we're going to shoot it some more. And so far, we've not had any trouble. I think I'll start out with a little pot smoking. Yeah. Just to get the day started, right? How's that? And a little Listerine killing. Now that's pot really smoked. Hot dog. There's another 12 oz. Boom. Hook the cap off. Let's go across the hill for a couple. Oh, and a cloud of dust. Look at that. Let's try that little one over there. Can't believe I can get anything. I'm having this deal with the uh classic AK sights here. I'll take it. I'll take every hit. I knew that was that I knew that was a hit after I heard the ring. Uh, one more over there. And you know what? Let's put a couple on these guys. Click. Okay. She's probably empty, you think? Yep. Let's look at it here a second. Okay. Yeah, we did the first one uh a while back as you might recall and shot it, played with it. John broke it. We'll talk about that. We take this one apart. And then the V2, they fixed some things. They've upgraded it here and there. And uh it uh it seems like a nice gun. Okay. Uh but I think they run around 7 750 something like that. Uh it's kind of a I don't know if that's a low-end AK. I guess that for an AK that's kind of maybe more in the middle, but it is a nice one. It's milled. That's the thing, you know. This is mil out of a whatever they they say 11 lb uh chunk of steel, you know. So, it's a has a milled receiver and that always adds to the cost. So, for a mil receiver uh AK, that's not bad.

Uh, uh, let me go ahead and take it apart before it gets too hot on me. You know what? I didn't bring my hammer out here. I was going to do that, but that's okay. It has a slightly thicker uh, dust cover, as I understand, than most. And here's the piece John broke on his. You might remember in that video. I don't know if they've improved that if it's still cast or or not. And we still aren't sure whether that was John's fault or the gun's fault, but you think an AK could take a beating, right? They're supposed to be able to take a beating. Uh keep on ticking. Okay. So, there's your bolt and everything. It's like an AK, doesn't it? Yeah. And uh it the machine work and everything on it. I'm not a machinist. I'm not an expert, but it looks really smooth. It it this looks really well done. I'll have to say. And uh I took this off uh and you know when you get a new AK or newer AK, generally speaking, this lever is like impossible to just pull up with your hands. I had a little brass hammer and punch I was going to bring out and take, but I did it just a little bit ago actually. Uh forgot to bring it out. And what I liked about it was the the gas tube up here. I I pull I got this up. You got to get it started with a brass something. Hit it. And uh when you get it up to here, it's fine. And then this just pull right out. Uh every AK I've had, you still had to hold your mouth right and jiggle it around and jiggle this around even after you have it loose and get the gas tube out. And uh but it just comes right out and right back in. Okay. So, just take my word for it since I'm too stupid to remember to bring my hammer and and chisel and and punch out here. But it it does seem to be well made. as I understand it is black nitride coated inside and out. And the more I read about that stuff, uh the better that seems to b",

I didn't really lube it much. Uh, had some fair amount of lube on it when we got it. So, been shooting it and uh, I have not moved the sights at all. It seems to be pretty much on. You know, I'm not going to do any 500 yard shooting or anything. Now, one thing about the dust cover, I'll tell you, uh, both John and I struggled until me being a genius figured it out. If you push that in like you normally do with the dust cover up that way and try to get it down, I you just can't do it. Uh, you would break something if you forced it. I discovered with it after a little frustration, you got to pull it back just a little bit because it it catches on the lip and then it's actually easier to put in, but you got to keep it in the groove up front. Okay? But it can't be fully forward. Got to pull it out just a little and struggle with There we go. It's not too hard once you get the hang of it. But I think the hole in the rear of the dust cover needs to be a little larger or something. There's something there's not a 100% fit. All right. So, cuz usually you just pop them in there and you just pop them in. It's not a problem. Okay. Especially if you're an AP expert. So, it's all Americanmade and uh and it feels good. The the pistol grip, of course, that's bragging on Magpole, I guess, but the pistol grip feels good to me. The trigger is good. I understand it's not a Tapco trigger or anything. It is a Sentry Arms. I think they're making the trigger. And it's a nice trigger. Kind of a two-stage. You pull uh uh back aways there. And And it's really clear when it's going to break. And it's got a nice break. I I don't know. I'd say 5 lbs, maybe four lbs. Uh not dangerously light or anything. Just Just right. So, I sound like I'm trying to sell you this rifle. I do like an AK.

One thing I didn't point out is they put a uh they put one of those safeties on that you can get from other sources. Uh well, Krebs custom. In fact, I have one. I tip I I had it on one of my AKs and I took it off. I don't know. It just doesn't seem like it ought to be on there, you know? Just isn't right having a safety or a bolt holdback on your safety, but it could be handy. You see how that works? Just literally grabs the bolt arm there and holds it back. Uh it it's kind of awkward to to get on though, so you know, it's not something you'd probably use that often, but doesn't hurt anything, I guess. Okay, so you have that. And it feels good. Like all the parts are made the way they ought to be made. Uh it feels fairly smooth for an AK. Yeah, very smooth right out of the box. And uh you know again that milled receiver uh is something that can can cost some money and I guess if it weren't for that you know this would be uh what $150 less probably. So it really be a low-end a great bargain. But if you want a milled receiver got to pay for it. So you're still talking 77 750s I understand. Uh standard AK sights front and rear. You know your your AK sight tool will adjust that for you. I've not adjusted anything on the sights. uh just uh just shot it and gone on. And uh you got your uh your sling attachment places and there is no uh oh here's a deal killer for you. I forgot one of the biggest negatives. There's no uh bayonet lug. So somehow you need to kind of get around that. Uh you could maybe duct tape a kitchen knife or your favorite bayonet or something onto it, but there's no bayonet lug and no cleaning cleaning rod and anything. So that's usually not a big deal. most people. Uh, anything else? Any other major negatives I can think of? The sights seem lined up, seem vertical, and uh, it's a pretty good looking gun.

It's really more of a treatment, I guess, than a coating. And it's supposed to be a really good treatment. So, that's one of the criticisms I think of the first model of this was the barrel was not really I don't think do it was it I don't think it was uh nitride, you know, treated uh or chrome lined, either one. Uh there may have been some that were, but I know some were not. The one we had, I think, was not treated. So, pretty good all around gun. I'll shoot a couple more times and uh make sure we're not leaving anything standing in this targetrich environment. I think I'll just not shoot the watermelon and uh get everybody mad at me, but I'll shoot that 2 liter. Oh. Oh, and I got a pot down there left to smoke. I'm I'm going to shoot him while he's down because there's still a little something left in him. Yeah, maybe you can take off that chip there. All right. Oh, propane tank and a plate. Nice. Nice. A little bit of cinder block left over there it looks like. Oh boy. I have trouble seeing the sights, but uh that little white dot helps so I can pretty much get it on. You know what? I think it's watermelon time. Don't you? All right, here we go. Caught him a little high to blow him up the way I wanted to. I got to finish with one on that little dot over there. I just feel better. And the burn barrel really does need some ventilation. All right, let's see if we're empty. We're empty. Uh if someone knows how to do it, maybe you'll write me and uh give me some advice on how to make an AK malfunction because I'm not very adept at it. They just the crazy things just tend to work. Uh really really they're fun guns to shoot. The uh the recoil impulse uh I guess it's because of the that's that's what it is.

I in my research, I didn't I didn't see much negative. Seemed like people were liking them so far. And uh and I I didn't uncover any big problems with this one. You know, like I said, we broke uh that little lug there on the one we had earlier. Again, whether that was us, whether that was John being too muscular with it or whatever, we're not sure. But uh but anyway, I don't know if they've changed that piece at all or or not, but it's a seems like a fine AK, best I can tell. If you can uh uh share different information or anything contradicts that, you know, let us know. But it it seems seems fine and we appreciate Buds Gun Shop uh sending it to us and uh you'll see it on EG gunner at some point.

There are limestone blocks that are 11 12 m long, like 4 m wide, you know, 230 tons that were stacked up on top of each other and they eroded so greatly on the inside that that they've actually fallen over at some point in antiquity. They've fallen off and so they are trying to buttress and support things that are going to fall. I'm all for that.

And if you look at the studies that have been done into like limestone erosion rates and there's been several they've studied them in coastal wave action environments where it's like getting battered by waves. They put in rivers, you know, they put limestone cubes on the top of one of the governmental buildings in DC and and left it there and studied it over decades and like, okay, it's tiny amounts, but in a normal weathering environment, right, this is assuming a lot more rainfall than what happens in Egypt, uh, which gets very little rainfall by the way, but a place like Washington DC or, uh, somewhere where you get like 40 40 inches of rain a year, something like that, it would take of just normal weathering erosion to do 2 ft of 2 feet of of erosion like this more than 100,000 years.

It does say Kuffra on there, but there's a lot of it's a controversial statement to say that that means Kuffra built it.

It's it's there's many places where you see just a huge amount of erosion that you can't really explain within the timelines and the climate of donastic Egypt as we know it from you know roughly 3000 BC till even now like because you've still it's still eroding right but yeah he he it could be vastly more ancient. I actually I actually think there's uh something else that came out uh was it earlier this year? I think it was much earlier this year or maybe late uh late last year. But there was a study done that showed that during the African humid period, so this period of time before the desert desertification of of Egypt, the Sahara becoming a desert when it was green and there was more consistent rainfall. There was obviously a lot more water in the Nile as we call it and it had different channels. One of the things they discovered was that there was a branch of the the river Nile and it's called the Aramat branch and it was in places up to a kilometer most of a mile wide. So it was quite a extensive branch but it turns out that all of these valley temples on all of these pyramid sites from Dashor and Sakara Abisia Abigarab Giza all of those valley temples were built on the shores of this extinct branch of the Nile.

So I was like, \"All right, I kind of whatever.\" And I almost couldn't go through with it because like the the um the initial descent they have to put weights on you. >> Oh boy. >> And it just goes against everything your body feels. >> Your body's like, \"No, no, no, no, no.\" >> Yeah. And they say like, you know, try to breathe measured. If you breathe a lot, you run out of air faster. >> Oh, fun. >> Right. So, it's like, yeah, just just hearing the fact, oh, you run out of air. >> Is the tank the the meter based on how much air is in or how much time? Like how much you've been breathing? Like, could you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and and breathe too much? Yes. >> And it wouldn't say E yet? >> No, no, no. I mean, I had the little dial >> so it'll show you. >> Yeah. And I was with someone. I was, you know, but still, by the way, it doesn't matter, by the way. So, it's like >> I couldn't get down. I'm claustrophobic and so I think that played into it. But like you have to start it just you have to overcome the sensation that you're maybe drowning or being suffocated like you know you go down and the weights start to pull you down and you adjust to breathing through here but then that's it. Like and if you want to like talk or it's like you don't you don't feel comfortable and you just want out there this you know you can't just get out and once you go down 30 feet or so you have to like you know you can't just shoot up either you have to go up like slowly obviously I mean it's not only 30 ft is the bends but like you know that whole thing and so 30 feet where you get ",

Few stocks that I was buying uh but no longer buying as well as a couple stocks that have sold out recently from and going to go through a little bit of rationale as to why I did all those things as well. So yes, please uh you know stay tuned. I'm going to try and go through this relatively quickly here. The first one that I'm buying right now is RXRX. Now I can talk about all the fundamentals if I want to. I don't think I really need to because if you just simply look at the institutional accumulation they've been gobbling up the shares ever since stock price been in this accumulation zone over here for a very long time especially over the last few months when price just basically in the dumpsters down here but volume was absolutely huge. Right? You can see that the last few months there's a lot of institutional buying over here. So what the heck is going on? Uh well there's something called WCOV accumulation pattern here and WOVF the whole idea is that you have a composite man is what um original Vikov was saying with uh with the whole composite man is basically a a person or group of people that are so powerful they can actually manipulate price of the stock and they can manipulate your emotions and there's certain patterns that can actually be seen based on the market based on where price is accumulation pattern usually comes in a little bit of a descending wedge over here where price continue to go down. That's where your motion tire you out and eventually some of this dip down here are absolutely areas to consider to accumulate because eventually once the accumulation is done you are going to show some sign of strength. You're going to break out of this accumulation zone and go higher. Usually the spring area down here is usually the maximum area of retail fear or or the small folks are just getting scared, you know, from stock based on price",

          "content": "does look more like an accumulation pattern over here. And I do feel a little bit safer to kind of, you know, buy down here with a high volume spring over here to see if it works out. Uh, it's a very small position of mine. If it doesn't work out, that's fine. If it works out, it could just become a bigger position of mine just over time. Um, which I'm completely fine with. I don't really need it to do anything immediately for, you know, for a very very short period of time. Like that's not how I operate. So, I'm okay with being a little bit more patient here. Now, with another stock that I've been buying here, I've basically built up a decent position here. I'm just waiting for it to do what I think it will do. It got rejected here. 0.86. This is Galaxy Digital GLXY. After it rejected, 0.86 just been selling sideways over here, forming a little bit of a bull flag here, but it's still about the monthly Goku cloud. It's still looking um pretty bullish here overall. was still um about the 0.786 over here too. Plus, if you do a gain square on the weekly, and I'm going to try to do this relatively quickly here. Look at the weekly and using the uh March 2020 as the pivot point for the GAN square. You can see how it's been following market symmetry very very well. The 45\u00b0 angle has been holding for quite some time. It broke above this arc over here. Back test about an arc got rejected at top over here. Broke through and right now it's back testing the top of the arc over here. And because it's also back testing the the top of the arc over here, I have to be bullish as support as an overall um pretty bullish market structure here. So I think that this thing um is going to go up higher because of that. On top of that, I also think that whenever things get to the higher fib levels um when it's already challenging 0.8 86. There's a good chance that it would probably end up breaking above and go higher. And I think that this is a good risk-reward ratio that I like to be at and",

Now, I am still waiting for a little bit more impossivity to happen with this stock. It simply has just really not been a able to really do that. has been going sideways over here for almost a year to the point that Ballinger band is starting to kind of contract here. But overall, the technical setup over here I still find to be favorable and I'm going to end up building a small position here. U I already have a position. I'm going to end up, you know, just adding a little bit more to it. Uh maybe every week or so I won't go crazy because it's a very volatile stock. It's a small cap. So I'm going to end up, you know, being a little bit more judicious when I'm trying to add to it. Um but it's not a bad looking formation here. This is another one that is also in a similar um boat here. This is BTCS. This is u essentially one of the original Ethereum treasuries here before the bigger names got a lot more attention. This is one of the smaller names, a smaller cap that seems to be a little bit more of OG of the Ethereum Treasury strategy and it's been forming higher highs and higher lows for a long time. We are having a little bit hard time bringing about the 0.7 618 over here. Bulling is expanding though. So we are just kind of consulting sideways over here. I find that this probably going to give me some opportunity to kind of buy a little bit more for longer. It's also kind of stuck sideways over here inside each move cloud but underneath the tank and the kitchen above. It's just rangebound but it's forming higher highs and higher lows. So the bias is going to be more bullishness moving forward but looks like it just keeps on wanting to give me time to to buy here. So, I'm going to end up just keep buying um that that's what I'm going to do with this thing. And then finally, this one might be a little bit surprise ",

Um I think that currently it is basically consolidating waiting for a potential breakout here. We are also basically gotten broken through the Ishimoka cloud here. Now when was the last time we were about the Ishimokco cloud? It was probably back in 2019. Um, and that has changed character here, right? We're holding between Ichimoku cloud. We're holding underneath the 0.618. I feel like I have a little bit more time potentially to buy. Even look at the weekly here. It has also broken through the weekly Ichimoku cloud and it's been waiting for a big giant cup here. Maybe a little bit of a handle here at the top of the Ichimoku cloud here before bullish continuation. I feel I still have a little bit more time to buy here. So, if that's the case, if this is a bullish formation and it is stuck in a range, it looks like it could give me a little bit more time to buy, maybe build a a position over time. I'm going to start DCA, start building a little bit of a position here for QBT. Now, again, why am I not on the other ones? Well, look at QBTS here. If you just look at the fib levels, it has a little bit more restriction. And if it goes up to some of the higher levels cuz it's a larger cap, it could 3x, 4x, maybe like, you know, 7 or 8x, it's just not as volatile. And that could potentially be a good thing because these are very risky assets. But I just find it to be a little bit, you know, larger cap here. And I because of what I'm seeing on the overall market, I want to be a little bit riskier. I want to be in a little bit smaller cap stocks with some potential higher side. If it doesn't work out, that's fine. If it works out, I think the um the risk miss is more asymmetric to the upside. So, I'm going to end up, you know, being a little bit in a smaller cap quantum play, if you will, rather than being in a larger cap like QTS. RTI, same story",

Um, I've been buying down here. Um, it's been I've been buying really over the last few months over here. I'm happy about Rivian because it's got the monthly bull squeeze and telling you that maybe a little bit of a trend change could happen. It's got the 20 month moving average that's with negative sloping resistance here to now um flat and serve as support. Right? This is a very decent trend change over here. I'm happy about Rivian.

Iron, why did I end up stop buying iron? Well, it's because I just can simply cannot justify buying anything that's way outside the upper bunch band over here. It's just really overextended. I don't really like the riskreward ratio of buying here. It could just keep going up higher and it could just run away from me and that's fine. I just don't feel like buying here. Tigr, why did I end up stop buying here? Well, because I've been buying it down here between 7 to N bucks right now. I basically said, hey, you know, if it's above 10, I'm going to probably stop buying it. Um because you're also hitting a 0.618 um resistance level up here. I don't know how long it's going to take for it to break through. I don't know if it's going to come back and retrace a lot further. I just don't find the risk reward ratio to be as good as it was before. Even though this is still a bullish stock, so I stopped adding to it. One other one that I also have stopped buying is BTBT. I am very happy with the position that I have. It's just been going sideways over here. It's been a little bit tr",

If price gets to um the 6.3 6.5 range at the IMO cloud up here and 0.5 up here, I think it's going to have a hard time breaking out that area. I don't think it's ready to go like pounds here or go anything crazy. The Ballinger Japan is also not that impulsively, you know, pointing up here. So I find it to most likely I'm getting stalled up around the area around 6.3 6.5 and I you know with me looking at small caps looking pretty well. Um I I just don't find the riskreward ratio to be that asymmetric. So I decided to sell out of it and rebalance to other things. The other one I also sold out uh from was Blackberry. I had a position end up selling it practically break even. The reason why I I end up doing that is I think it's a bullish stock. I think the bullish band is um is expanding here a little bit. I think the 20 month moving average is being claimed for resistance here into support but it's just simply consoliding sideways over here and it's probably going to end up taking some time. It needs to break above the tank in the kitchen. You have the cloud resistance up here around six bucks. You know, I think there's going to be a lot more resistance moving forward. So, I decided to kind of sell out of it and decided to kind of re reallocate to some of the other stocks that I feel may have a little bit more asymmetric upside even though these are still bullish stocks. All right, guys. Thanks so much for listening to this video. Have a good one. Bye.",

          "content": "with our listening audience. Yeah, thanks. >> So, let's recap what you had talked about on my show. Last time you're on, which was late August, August 27th. Check out our interview with Gary, late August. Link down below. Back then, you had called back then, it wasn't even that long ago. It was 6 weeks, not even. You had called for the upside target of gold to be at 37 to 3,800. You had called for the breakout to happen anytime within the next 2 to 3 weeks on the back of a Fed cut. That's exactly what happened. The only thing that didn't really happen according to your expectations was that gold exceeded your upside by $200, which is not an insignificant insignificant amount of time. Sorry, insignificant amount by magnitude by gold standards is what I meant to say. So, let's recap first of all why you got the timing right, what went right in your opinion, and why gold moved even faster than what you initially expected. >> Absolutely. Unquestionably, when I was looking at this and when we spoke about a month ago, I had my targets, but I greatly underestimated the speed and pace in which it would hit those numbers. Um, I'm always happy when I undersshoot a target rather than overshoot a target. In other words, if I was calling for $5,000 per ounce gold, that would be quite disappointing. If I undersshoot it or get the timing off, that's just the market. The market is not going to react to what I said. It it's whether or not you can correctly anticipate where it might go. The timing is always uh a little bit more difficult to nail um in terms of the pace in which we will see uh gold prices rise. Yeah. >> Because it's risen a lot faster than what you initially expected. Are you more bearish now? Are you concerned? basically about this this pace of move. >> Well, actually in in my sense I believe that a correction would be a warranted and not change my overall bullish demeanor. In other words, typically a market that is in a very strong rally mode, uh, bullish undertones",

I want to see how uh you drew the conclusion that gold would hit 3,700 by to 3,800. And then um where I'm going with this is I want to see uh the pattern in which gold moved and how much it's broken above your initial expectation. Is there a historical precedent by uh by which gold has broken your expectation to the upside by this amount? And then we'll see what happened if that has happened in the past. Yeah, >> sure. Well, I brought up a a daily standard Japanese candlestick chart of gold. And I'm looking at what's called a Fibonacci retracement from 3,300 and that occurred uh during the last week of June. And what we saw really was a small rally up and then an actual correction. This would have been about a 50% correction from this initial move. And what happened was the trend got so strong that we would see gold ascend. So it ascends from uh $3,360 up to about $3670 and then you rather than getting a correction you get consolidation or sideways market moves in which during that time period so for example on uh Monday September the 15th it tested uh certain levels but couldn't break it. When the breakout did come, which started on the 19th of September, it ran from 3685 up to about 37.85. So, you had a really strong move in a short period of time and then a short period of consolidation. So, you're getting the market running up to uh new all-time record highs because this is all uncharted territory. And rather than getting a correction, you get consolidation. It basically trades sideways for a period and then goes and makes a new level. You get a short period here of only four trading days. Sideways up to a new level, a a new record high at around 38.887. 3 days of consolidation and then this last move.

What will cause what will be the trigger for the breakout either to the upside or the downside? Remember those conversations? And it makes sense because between 2020 to 2022 when I first started working with you, gold was trading in a rangebound in a range. And gold has historically, if you look all the way back, gold has historically in most situations, except for a few dramatic bull runs, traded within a range and then moved up slowly. Over the last two years, however, the tone of our conversations have shifted dramatically. Now, I'm asking you, gee, it's moved up a lot. Has it moved up too fast? These are the conversations I've asked you in 2020. Has gold fundamentally changed its role for the investor? Has there been a paradigm shift? Whether uh rather than being a safe, stable, slowly moving asset like what it was doing in 2020, 2021, now it's moving parabolic parabolically upwards, it's up 25% just in the just in the last couple of weeks since 2024. I'm looking at my screen, it's up 124%. That's not something you would attribute as let's say a safe haven asset by definition, right? >> Uh typically not. Typically not.

That got taken out like a like a runaway freight train, so to speak. It quickly moved from 3600 to about 38. And let me move this back to a regular candlestick chart because you don't get true opens and closes. Um, you can see that the body size has increased over these last two cycles or weeks. We had gains all the way through, but these were small gains. Uh, the week beginning Monday, September the 8th, very, very small gain. The week beginning on the 15th, the week beginning on the 22nd. these last two weeks and of course this week is coming to a conclusion it's not over yet but you've had huge movements and you really I mean the top I I had called for was 3800 so what do you do when that target is taken out as it was well you re-evaluate where it could go upside potential to me is anywhere between 41 and 4200 if it continues to move up that would be my upside breakout out target. I don't think that if we get a correction that it will be a longlasting in terms of time, but it could be a fairly deep correction. We could see pricing go from it went from 30 3370 up to this all-time record high above 4,000 4,076. It would came back down during this same week at around 39.990, which tells me that on a technical basis, our resistance level is at $4,000 per ounce only because it's backed off. And when we look at these other candles, you can see this upper wick um last week was very short. the prior week they're very very short um upper wicks telling you that the closing price was very very near the intra week high of that candle and the same with last week. This week it's different. We had this exaggerated high 476 and now it is back below 4,000 at about 3985. So 4,000 is definitely what we're looking at in terms of resistance. I've already t",

Well, besides the fundamentals, which is um perceived Federal Reserve action, uh whether or not they're going to implement uh interest rate cuts, which is been getting factored into current pricing, the the rise here is anticipating that the Fed is going to be much more accommodative and implement two interest rate cuts at the final two FOMC meetings this year. And that's already factored in. That's part of why gold has moved as high as it has and as quickly as it has is the belief of a extremely accommodative accommodative Federal Reserve. If that is what actually unfolds as we go into these meetings, uh then you could see consolidation, you could see a market correction. What's amazing to me is that this path, if you even look back to the beginning of the year in January, gold's at $6,300 and then by May it's at $3,200. And then if you look at these last 7, eight weeks, they have been tremendous. We've seen it before. We saw it back in January. But these weekly moves in terms of price differential between the opening price on Monday and the closing price on Friday were much smaller than what we're seeing now. We've seen gold move up and then go sideways with the bias to the downside. But this is a very rare occurrence to have new all-time record closing prices on a weekly basis and then that's followed by a higher opening price the following Monday. And that's what we've seen for the last 8 weeks. >> I I'm just musing you here, but um it strikes me that we haven't adjusted for inflation. These are nominal values, not real growth of the gold price. Perhaps we have seen this pattern before. Um I I I like to do this analysis at some point and maybe share with you next time.

It's touched 49 twice. only twice in the last 50 years. Now, I want to ask you before we get to your silver price forecast, why has silver taken so long to catch up to its all-time highs when gold has been breaking all-time highs for basically two and a half years straight? Um I think the primary reason is that when we look at gold that seems to be the standard in terms of a safe haven that's an inflationary hedge where silver isn't perceived to have the same kind of weight in that way. When we look at the recent move in silver you can see that back as recently as the beginning of August silver's at $36. And if we look back, let me compress this chart. You've got to go back quite a ways to see what we were witnessing. We had 32, 33, 33. These were absolute tops that silver couldn't break. We've consistently seen silver for the last few years. Fine. We had a period in time when silver had come down and then actually hit 26 but then quickly retraced to 17. And then you have this almost triple top, absolutely a double top of silver at $26. This is back in December uh 2023. It makes a new top at 32 and then another one at 34 October of 2024 and then again in April of 2025 it corrects and then you get these new levels $39. But then you get a parabolic move in silver from about $37. And what's interesting to me is the intraday and intrae high and I'll kind of blow that up again is $50. And so we know that historically silver has touched this level. But I believe only once prior to this and that's when uh what was it? The Hunts the Hunt brothers were trying to capture that market and whether or not they were successful, they did drive the price up. What I'm seeing now in silver is this. You've had silver move from $36 in July 2025 to top out at about 38 and change and then form a double and then a triple top. Then you had it come up to ",

          "content": "off, let me just finish off with a comparison between gold and silver. So if you allow me to switch over to my screen now, Gary, I've plotted gold and silver together. Silver is a blue line, gold is a bar chart. And this is a 12month chart, historical 12-mon trailing 12 month. Uh and in the last 12 months, gold is up 52%, silver is up 57 uh 58%. So roughly the same with silver slightly outperforming. And if you look even closer, the outperformance really started to happen in the last 6 months. So if you'll notice that um in the first half of the year, silver has been lagging gold. Um so I'm I'm zooming in from January 2025 to June 2025. And you'll see that silver has been lag moving in the same direction, but not moving as much as gold. This outperformance really started to happen around June. And now since uh June, silver is up 50% 47% and gold's up 19.20% only. So gold's been pretty much sideways to up in the last 6 months while silver shot in a straight line. Given this pattern, do you think that silver will continue to outperform gold to this degree in the next 6 months? Typically, uh, what I've seen historically in terms of the relationship between gold prices and silver prices is that silver tends to outperform the percentage change in terms of gains on the way up, but also have a greater percentage draw down or price decline during periods of correction. Silver is a much more volatile metal in terms of price than gold. And so when you see them, they typically do move in tandem to the upside sideways or correcting. But silver tends to lead the way in terms of percentage gains on the way up and percentage declines on the way down. You also see a greater variance in terms of volatility. uh between let's say an intra week high and the closing price in silver than you have in gold. That has been a characteristic of silver for years is that it tends to outperform in terms of percentage gains and percentage declines when you compare it to gold. I I just wonder if th",

Let's break down some of these factors driving Bitcoin to new highs, and it's not just Bitcoin, by the way, bunch of other alts as well. >> Yeah, sure. So, I just think there's been so much that's happened this year really centered around clarity from the US and a lot of steps that have been taken um administration really following through on promises that were made around digital assets. And so we, you know, recently had crypto week several weeks ago where some of this legislation was kind of, you know, actually put forward and um and and taken to the next stage. And so I think it's just really we're seeing so much clarity after so many years of uncertainty around the regulation of crypto assets, uh, Bitcoin, stable coins, uh, etc. And then at the same time, we're seeing this wave of digital asset treasury companies that are bringing in crypto into the public markets in a more in a in a huge way.

Like I mentioned uh in my introduction, Ethereum had a huge move. This is the ETH chart. ETHUSD bit of a pullback since mid August. Now I again is this the same narrative here because Bitcoin's been moving ahead of Ethereum. In fact, Bitcoin's been leading Ethereum basically for most of the year until we've had this huge rally starting July. What happened here to ETH and the alt space? >> Yeah, I think that the alts are we're not in alt season yet. I think Bitcoin has definitely been leading the charge and you mentioned the the pullback that's happened. I think yeah 78% from the 124k high that was after the US inflation reports came back in higher than uh what was previously forecasted and so I think that you know that always has an impact on uh risk assets like like Bitcoin but I do think that the pullback is really being seen as more of a consolidation phase rather than us going into a reversal. So there's, you know, there's there's much more to come in this market, but with with with ETH and with different alts, I think that there's there's still a lot of um there's still a lot of room to grow in this cycle.

Regulatory changes have already happened. They'll continue to happen, but most of that is now expected. What else is new? Yeah, on the Bitcoin side, the treasury companies, I I think just in general, we've seen tens of billions of dollars being raised by crypto treasury companies. Most of that is concentrated in Bitcoin because it is the leading asset. And for a lot of those companies, they have not necessarily executed their purchases of Bitcoin. So, it just comes back to supply and demand. And there is a fixed number of Bitcoin and we just keep seeing more and more demand coming in through the creation of these vehicles. And uh and that's just really the initial capital raises for these vehicles when they're when they're public. Their mandate is go out and tap capital markets, debt markets, uh bond markets, and buy more Bitcoin. And then because that's been so successful for Micro Strategy and it has been the best performing stock um you know in the last several years year after year other crypto assets are following suit ETH Salana and then other altcoins and and and using this strategy. So I do think that that's a a key piece aside from the regulatory side which you said um and kind of alluded to earlier which really just allows more institutions to play. they have a much higher degree of comfort with playing with these crypto assets and then you know retail will will follow. >> Does this not present more of a risk",

So I think there'll be sort of a natural cap for these as they as they get to to that size. Um it it definitely does concentrate things a little bit more. Um but I think in general it's positive because it just creates a better access point for um for investors that don't or can't hold crypto directly. So, you know, there's thousands and um you know, sorry, millions and millions of uh of shareholders that um that hold stock in these companies.

Stable coins represent a revolution in digital finance, he said. Published July 18th. The dollar now has an internet native payment rail that is fast, frictionless, and free of middlemen. This groundbreaking technology will buttress the dollar status as a global reserve currency, expand access to the dollar economy for billions across the globe, and lead to a surge in demand for US treasuries. Now, we're just wondering whether or not, first of all, do you agree with that statement? And second, if that is going to be true, I wonder if that provides a headwind to Bitcoin. Bitcoiners have long positioned themselves as one of the anti-dollar assets along with gold and other things. And so, if there's going to be more demand for uh dollars on the blockchain, in other words, stable coins, and more demand for treasuries, does that necessarily mean less demand for Bitcoin? I'll let you evaluate this. >> Yeah, I would say no. I think they're complimentary in the sense that Bitcoin will, you know, Bitcoin won't take over the global money supply and uh replace all money um all all fiat currency. I think it's it's something that will continue to grow and I think it's at sort of 2% of global money supply now. Um and and certainly is going to continue to grow, but I do see like I'm I'm a believer that, you know, both um both assets will continue to exist. And so that means that uh people that hold Bitcoin are still going to need to interact with the traditional financial system in some way. And that's why stable coins have grown so much in the last I mean four years or so. I think it's I think they're around $150 billion market cap now. And um we're you know don't quote me on it but I think sort of four you know 4 to5 billion in 2021 or or maybe it was yeah some something around there.

But let's say if you were to start from scratch, >> if you were to build another company, >> you know what what would you capitalize on? >> Yeah. So I just went through this exercise um after Wonderfy. I was you know I took some time off and was starting to explore what is next and couldn't help but go down the AI rabbit hole and got extremely excited about the the potential of AI. I think it's the most powerful tool that we are creating in the history of humanity and it's um it's it's really exciting. So that certainly is the area of focus. And um and for me, the further that I went down that rabbit hole, the more excited I got, but also the more terrified I got of realizing that we just have a handful of companies that are controlling this future. And it's it's it's it's really social media all over again where we have a you know we had a few companies with this extremely powerful network that um have control over it and are and and have used it in nefarious ways and now this is something that is far more powerful and everpresent than social media and again it's a few companies that control it. So the problem that I've chose to focus on is is AI and um and through researching this problem I came across Bit Tensor which is a decentralized AI network that um I think will solve the problem of of centralized AI. >> What exactly is decentralized AI? What does that mean? >> So Bitensor so Bitensor decentralized AI is what open AI was supposed to be. So the the original mission of OpenAI was um ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity.

Um, Bit Tensor is so I I would say Bitcoin has created the world's largest supercomputer by a huge factor. So, um, it's proven that decentralized networks and and compute can scale faster than anything that is centralized. And the Bitcoin computer really is solving math puzzles. And that's the that's the way that mining works on on on the Bitcoin network. And so Bit Tensor has taken that structure of Bitcoin, it's taken the same economics as Bitcoin and it's applying it to building this uh AI supercomputer and that is one that anyone can use and anyone can contribute to. So it doesn't have the censorship and bias issues that um chat GPT has for example. Um and the way that the network works is when you send so for example you there are um chat GPT style apps that are built on Bit Tensor and when you're using that instead of it uh going to a model that OpenAI has created which is siloed and nobody can you know see or understand what is happening um it's going to the Bit Tensor network and it's getting sent to um uh hundreds of different miners that are all contributing open- source um AI models to solve the problem in the most effective way and then the network is scoring the outputs and then and ranking them and the most effective uh the most high quality output is getting shared with with the with the user.

Can you tell us your prediction short-term, long-term, uh maybe 2025 and 2026? Sure. Uh yeah, we've been really encouraged by the interest from the traditional asset management community into Bitcoin ETFs, especially since the election. Uh my inbound phone calls are up like 300%. from investment adviserss who were afraid to allocate to Bitcoin ETFs and now with the election and the change in administration, they're much more open to discussing uh the investment case for Bitcoin. So this is obviously a very volatile asset and so we look at the short term tends to be driven by macro considerations, liquidity trends and technicals. So assuming that Bitcoin can get through this period of uncertainty, which we think is macro driven, interest rates come down, the Fed gets a little easier, we think the second half of the year should be quite positive and that Bitcoin could reach 180,000 per coin. That's based on an analysis of previous Bitcoin cycles which have tended to get smaller over time. But the previous smallest Bitcoin cycle was a 20x return from the trough to the peak. If we can do a 10x return this cycle, that would imply 180K. So that's kind of our guidepost for this year. Uh again, liquidity and technicals could change that, but that's my base case is 180 for this year. For those advisers taking a longer term perspective, we benchmark Bitcoin against gold. Specifically, the 50% of the gold market that is more speculative in nature. So about half of gold goes into jewelry or industrial use cases. Put putting that aside, if Bitcoin can reach the 50% of gold that's speculative in nature, that would imply roughly 450,000 per coin. So I know a lot of folks are calling it for that this year. that would mark a break in that cycle. You know, each cycle gets smaller for Bitcoin. So, I have a hard time calling that for this cycle, but that could be may",

They have ETFs. Do people understand them? How are they performing? Yeah. Um in contrast to those inbound phone calls from advisers who want to talk about Bitcoin, we have not really seen the same um curiosity or bullishness on some of the altcoins. Uh I think a lot of that comes down to performance. Uh they've been underperforming. Uh another part is related to the use case. U so um much of it is kind of speculative in nature. We haven't really seen the transmission mechanism whereby say stable stablecoin aum starts to generate meaningful fees for say ethereum token holders or salana token holders. I think some of that um is still ahead of us as deregulation kicks off in the US. It's actually pretty hard to say buy Salana based USDC if you're here in New York State. the regulator just makes it very difficult. So, as that as those regulations ease, you know, we're optimistic that some of those real world use cases can kick off, but right now with the over supply in tokens, with meme coins kind of sucking up some of the liquidity, uh, it's definitely a bare market in the altcoins. You think that's going to change? I think it will once a significant quantum of Bitcoin wealth has been created. So the history of the asset class is once Bitcoin can kind of pump 30 to 50% then a lot of those gains get recycled into newer projects uh there's just been too many uh newer projects and Bitcoin's down flat year to date. Um so I I do think you know when these ETFs come to market when staking is permitted when you can um create and redeem these ETFs using inind so the coins themselves not just cash that means every broker dealer in the US is going to be need to touching crypto directly that means that they're more likely to hold some for working capital purposes and the coins that maybe have lower inflation rates y",

Is that what's happening right now? The 30% retracement. Is that the period we're in right now? I think it is. Okay. So, we've already hit the peak in Q1. Is that kind of the rationale? Yeah. I mean our our initial idea was that the inauguration would prompt a blowoff top to say 125. Then the reality would set in. Governing is hard. Deregulation is hard. There's many entrenched interests that will fight against it and you'd have a draw down in kind of Q2 Q3 before a subsequent rally. So we never hit that 125K. Instead we just got the draw down. I think we should remember in 2021 um there was a 54% Bitcoin draw down from the March peak uh until the October peak. So it feels like we're in a period kind of like that. Uh you talked about a Bitcoin strategic reserve in this um report. This was written before Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve that was signed into executive action a couple weeks ago. How does that change the calculus for your forecast for uh some of the larger layer ones? I think it's in line with our expectations. Uh the US government is very unlikely to acquire altcoins in the open market. My reading of the executive order is that it allows for the government to hold on to whatever altcoins may be seized, but it also gives them the freedom to sell them if they want. We could have a scenario where the government is selling altcoins and buying Bitcoin because the strategic reserve for Bitcoin explicitly uh lays out a scenario where the government is acquiring Bitcoin in the open market albeit in a revenue neutral model. So maybe that means selling alts and and buying Bitcoin. Um but I don't I I wouldn't say that we've become more bullish on alts because of the uh stockpile that was announced. Would you",

What are some of the um bull cases for holding on to a crypto company versus just the layer one itself? Yeah. Um, so we've actually uh been doing a lot more work in the equity space this year. Uh, part of the reason for that is that we saw that the 2024 vintage of altcoins was not designed particularly well. They were either meme coins with no utility and no pass through or they were kind of layer twos with a lot of inflation and no logical buyer. Um, in contrast, the equity universe uh just doesn't have the same amount of inflation, right? Um, so if you look at the available supply of equities that are geared to Bitcoin and digital assets right now, it's roughly $200 billion of stocks. A lot of that is Coinbase, Micro Strategy, and then the Bitcoin miners. And there are a number of IPOs that we're expecting this year. Some of them are here in this room. I saw Gemini, for example, with a booth. But even if you to add up all of the market cap of those companies that might come public this year, it's maybe 20 billion. So 20 billion on a base of 200 billion. It's not a huge amount of supply. As long as these companies are profitable, we think that they could have, you know, some valuation support. Uh and we've seen the performance of companies that just add a little bit of Bitcoin to their balance sheet. Sometimes the best performing stocks are not the pure plays. They're the companies that have say 1% exposure to crypto and it's going to 5%. You know, and Robin Hood would be a good example of a company like that. Their crypto exposure a couple years ago was Dominus. Now it's almost 30% of the business and Robin Hood's been able to use that uh kind of innovation on digital assets to capture other customers and it's helping their multiple.

What's happening? Yeah. Uh this is a digestion period for macro observers. Uh the uncertainty around the administration's approach to tariffs caused a pull forward of economic activity. So lots of companies bought goods from overseas in Q4 before the tariffs would go into effect. And as a result, kind of Q4 GDP was overstated and there's a bit of an air pocket in Q1 GDP. And as the market woke up to that, GDP estimates fell, earnings estimates fell and US, specifically US tech has started to underperform dramatically. the rest of the markets and because Bitcoin and other digital assets have been reasonably highly correlated to US tech, they got hit as well. Our reading of some of the sentiment indicators shows that last week there really were some kind of peak fear indicators in the market. And so we're optimistic that there'll be a rebound in Q2. The market will get more certainty around the tariffs. And this was more of a one-time than a persistent negative impact on GDP because even if we get tariffs, there's going to be a deregulation um uh agenda out of this administration. There's going to be tax cuts. The second half of the year looks a lot better from our perspective. So still pretty bullish, maybe more even equity performance where US tech is not such an outperformer.

There's no discounted cash flow you can use to value gold. There's no DCF to value Bitcoin. How do you know if Bitcoin or any other layer one is fairly valued at any given point? Yeah. I mean, so for Bitcoin, the empirical model is a comparative one. And I think that um your observation is correct that there's no discounted cash flow model you can build. It's all based on what its perceived value. Um that's different from from from some of the proof ofstake networks like Ethereum and Salana where the level of complexity in the transactions is much higher. uh you can build these logical loops if A then B and users have proven that they're willing to pay for those transactions and the fees that users pay end up in the token holders pocket in some way or another whereas for Bitcoin the fees that users pay end up in the Bitcoin miner valuation right so you can build DCFs for some of these layer 1 tokens u I don't think that they have much predictive ability as to how the token trades. Um, you know, this is retail driven market uh driven by flows and sentiment and vibe.

Uh it helps to be generous and I think that's kind of the approach that the Ethereum Foundation has taken with the L2s is that they want to get as many out there as possible to try to find product market fit.

In that sort of a context, the Fed will cut rates pretty aggressively. That's what they did in 2001. To zero, probably not, but to 2% possibly. Of course, what's different now is that in 2001 when the Fed cut rates that created a new bubble which sort of rescued the economy temporarily, the housing bubble. uh we might not get a second bubble this time around in which case the downturn could be somewhat deeper. >> Scott Bent named his picks for the next Fed chair. Um most of them I believe are uh very doubbish. Correct me if I'm wrong. Um is the market just essentially pricing in that the Fed will cut aggressively despite uh or regardless of where inflation is headed from here? Peter, >> well dovish or obsequious? I mean, it's it's a fine line, I suppose. Um, you know, I I think right now it's okay to be doubbish because the economy isn't in great health. Certainly, the labor market looks very very uh vulnerable. I think the problem would be is if the Fed were to cut rates against the backdrop where the economy is starting to heat up, inflation is rising. That could cause real problems for the uh bond market. I don't think it's going to happen though. Like, you know, I I worked in Washington for a very long time. Like, the Fed is li",

There's a lot of speculation as to what this rise in gold is signing. You even posted yourself on your views on the recent search. This is what you had to say 3 days ago on LinkedIn. Despite the surge in gold prices this year, the amount of gold held in US ETFs is still below where it was in 2022, the tactical where my tactical quant model, which brings together dozens of leading indicators for gold prices, remains bullish. Here you have a price of gold versus ETF holdings. Uh, as you can see, it's more or less parabolic. I'm talking about the price. Um, and this is your quant model. Maybe explain how this model works and ultimately why you're still bullish at $4,000. I mean, gold has fallen somewhat, like 12, 11, 12% since its highs. Uh but it's still $4,000 right now. >> Yeah. I mean, the model's been bullish for a while and, you know, it's done really well uh for for our readers. Um it's still bullish because kind of the medium-term trend remains to the upside even if the short-term trend has deteriorated. Now we have kind of this daily model as well for gold which did turn a little bit bearish but kind of the threemonth model is bullish because it senses that the underlying trend is still to the upside that you have these fundamental tailwinds for gold. The fact that central banks are uh buying gold in large quantities. the fact that fiscal policy remains unsustainable across much of the uh developed world and the fact that retail interest is only now perking up. You know what that chart that you just showed illustrates is that the amount of gold in US listed ETFs is still below where it was in 2022. So if you look at the amount of gold in like GLD, it hasn't even returned to where it was back then. Typically, the end of a bull market occurs when you have this massive wave of retail participation. That's happening now, but we haven't reached a cre",

Um I'll let you comment on that, but I have some specific sectors I'd like you to address. So, people have been talking about nuclear power as the future, and Trump has made nuclear um power a little more accessible to to industry. He's um he's deregulated some of the mining restrictions around uranium. Uh what's your take on nuclear? I >> mean, it's it's it's it's it's a good technology in the current age, but it's also one that is not undiscovered. People in the investment community know the story and they know the story well and some of the stocks that are levered to this uh theme are very expensive. Some of them don't even have any revenue yet. Uh I think that trade has uh gone past this expiration date. >> What what's the investment thesis behind hyperscalers? Are we are we investing in real estate um in urban centers? Are we investing in cloud services uh big tech names? What's the play here? Well, you're investing in the AI dream. You're investing in the hope that uh these companies will be able to monetize the investments that they've undertaken. But the bar for that is just really really high. Uh probably by the end of this decade, at least based on current analyst consensus estimates, you're going to have close to like a mill like close to a trillion dollars in annual capex. Uh now to profitably monetize that you're going to need something like $2 trillion in annual uh revenue uh that's going to be really hard to generate. I mean the combined sales if you look at sort of trailing 12 month sales of Microsoft, Google, AWS, Oracle, Meta, it only adds up to about a trillion. Um so where are we going to get two trillion in annual sales from? Unless AI really takes off, uh, it's just not going to happen. In which case, those stocks are going to go down.

They're going to talk about how they're focused on the labor market, how the recent data hasn't been abysmal, but hasn't really been very supportive either. They're going to talk about inflation, uh, what's happening to actual inflation, inflation expectations. That I think is a concern for them.
